        "question": "<input> Xenia and Sergey play the following game. Xenia thinks of a positive integer $N$ not exceeding 5000. Then she fixes 20 distinct positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{20}$ such that, for each $k=1,2, \\ldots, 20$, the numbers $N$ and $a_{k}$ are congruent modulo $k$. By a move, Sergey tells Xenia a set $S$ of positive integers not exceeding 20 , and she tells him back the set $\\left\\{a_{k}: k \\in S\\right\\}$ without spelling out which number corresponds to which index. How many moves does Sergey need to determine for sure the number Xenia thought of? </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Key Concepts:** Congruence modulo, distinct integers, set operations.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the minimum number of moves required to guarantee identifying the number N.\n\n**2. Analyze the Congruence Conditions:**\n\n*   **Modulo Properties:** For each k (1-20), N \u2261 a_k (mod k). This means N - a_k is divisible by k.\n*   **Implication:** If we know a_k for a particular k, we can narrow down the possible values of N to those that are congruent to a_k modulo k.\n\n**3. Consider the Information from Each Move:**\n\n*   **Set S:** Sergey chooses a set S of indices (1-20). Xenia returns the set {a_k | k \u2208 S}.\n*   **Information Gained:** The set {a_k | k \u2208 S} provides information about the congruence of N modulo the values of k in S.\n\n**4. Strategy Development:**\n\n*   **Information Theory Perspective:** Each move provides a certain amount of information. The goal is to minimize the number of moves while maximizing the information gained.\n*   **Binary Search Analogy:** Consider how to narrow down the possible values of N using the information from each move.\n*   **Key Insight:** The values of a_k for different k's are not independent. The congruence conditions are related, and the information from one move can be used to inform the next.\n\n**5. Consider the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine the number of moves required to guarantee finding N, regardless of the values of a_k.\n*   **Strategy:** Develop a strategy that works for any possible set of a_k values.\n\n**6. Consider the Number of Possible Values for N:**\n\n*   **Range:** N is a positive integer not exceeding 5000.\n*   **Implication:** There are 5000 possible values for N.\n\n**7. Consider the Information from Each Move:**\n\n*   **Information per Move:** Each move provides information about the congruence of N modulo certain values.\n*   **Goal:** Determine how many moves are needed to narrow down the possible values of N to a single value.\n\n**8. Consider the Use of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n\n*   **CRT:** If the moduli are pairwise coprime, the system of congruences has a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli.\n*   **Application:** If Sergey can determine the congruence of N modulo a set of pairwise coprime integers, he can uniquely determine N.\n\n**9. Develop a Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Choose a set of indices S1 such that the corresponding moduli are pairwise coprime. This will allow Sergey to narrow down the possible values of N.\n*   **Step 2:** Based on the information from the first move, choose a set of indices S2 that will further narrow down the possible values of N.\n*   **Step 3:** Repeat the process, choosing sets of indices that progressively narrow down the possible values of N.\n*   **Step 4:** Continue this process until only one possible value of N remains.\n\n**10. Determine the Minimum Number of Moves:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Find the minimum number of moves required to guarantee identifying N.\n*   **Considerations:** The number of possible values of N, the information gained from each move, and the strategy used.\n*   **Answer:** The minimum number of moves required is 2.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

        "question": "<input> Given a positive integer $n$, determine the largest real number $\\mu$ satisfying the following condition: for every $4 n$-point configuration $C$ in an open unit square $U$, there exists an open rectangle in $U$, whose sides are parallel to those of $U$, which contains exactly one point of $C$, and has an area greater than or equal to $\\mu$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Key Concepts:** Open unit square, open rectangle, point configuration, area, and the goal is to find the largest possible area (mu) that guarantees a rectangle with exactly one point.\n\n**2. Simplify and Consider Special Cases:**\n\n*   **Small n:** Start with small values of n (e.g., n=1, n=2) to get a sense of the problem. For n=1, the problem becomes finding the largest area of a rectangle that can contain exactly one point in a 4-point configuration.\n*   **Symmetry:** Consider symmetric configurations of points. This might help in finding the optimal rectangle.\n\n**3. Consider the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n\n*   **Optimal Configuration:** The value of mu will be determined by the worst-case configuration of points. We need to find the configuration that minimizes the maximum area of a rectangle containing exactly one point.\n*   **Spacing:** Consider how the points are spaced. If the points are too close together, it might be difficult to find a rectangle with a large area containing only one point.\n\n**4. Use Geometric Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Divide and Conquer:** Divide the unit square into smaller regions. If we can find a way to divide the square such that each region contains at most one point, we can find a rectangle that contains exactly one point.\n*   **Area Considerations:** The area of the rectangle must be greater than or equal to mu. This means we need to find a way to ensure that the area of the rectangle is large enough, even in the worst-case scenario.\n\n**5. Consider the Area of the Unit Square:**\n\n*   **Total Area:** The area of the unit square is 1. The total area of the rectangles that contain exactly one point must be less than or equal to 1.\n*   **Average Area:** If we have 4n points, and we want to find a rectangle that contains exactly one point, we can consider the average area of the rectangles that contain exactly one point.\n\n**6. Consider the Number of Points:**\n\n*   **4n Points:** The number of points is 4n. This suggests that we might need to divide the square into 4n regions, each containing one point.\n*   **Divide the Square:** Consider dividing the square into smaller rectangles. If we can divide the square into 4n rectangles, each containing one point, then the area of each rectangle would be 1/(4n). This suggests that mu is at least 1/(4n).\n\n**7. Consider the Optimal Rectangle:**\n\n*   **Largest Area:** We want to find the largest possible area (mu) that guarantees a rectangle with exactly one point. This means we need to find the configuration of points that minimizes the maximum area of a rectangle containing exactly one point.\n*   **Optimal Configuration:** The optimal configuration of points will be the one that makes it as difficult as possible to find a large rectangle containing exactly one point.\n\n**8. Consider the Area of the Rectangle:**\n\n*   **Area Formula:** The area of a rectangle is width * height.\n*   **Maximize the Area:** We want to maximize the area of the rectangle, given the constraints.\n\n**9. Consider the Position of the Rectangle:**\n\n*   **Position:** The position of the rectangle within the unit square will affect the area.\n*   **Optimal Position:** We need to find the position of the rectangle that maximizes the area, given the constraints.\n\n**10. Consider the Final Answer:**\n\n*   **Largest Real Number:** The final answer will be the largest real number mu that satisfies the condition.\n*   **Form of the Answer:** The answer will likely be a simple fraction, such as 1/(4n) or 1/(2n).\n\n**11. Generalize the Solution:**\n\n*   **General Case:** The solution should be generalizable to any positive integer n.\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Look for a pattern in the solutions for small values of n.\n\n**12. Justify the Answer:**\n\n*   **Proof:** The answer should be justified with a proof that shows that the value of mu is the largest possible value that satisfies the condition.\n*   **Counterexamples:** Consider counterexamples to show that a larger value of mu would not satisfy the condition.\n\n**13. Final Answer:**\n\n*   **State the Answer:** The final answer will be the largest real number mu that satisfies the condition.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understand the Sequences:**\n\n*   **Sequence x_n:**  This is a recursive sequence defined by $x_1 = a$ and $x_{n+1} = 2x_n + 1$.  We need to understand how this sequence grows.\n*   **Sequence y_n:**  This is defined as $y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1$.  We need to analyze the properties of this sequence, particularly its primality.\n\n**2. Analyze the Sequence x_n:**\n\n*   **Find a closed-form expression for x_n:**  Try to find a formula for $x_n$ in terms of $a$ and $n$. This will help us understand the growth of the sequence.\n*   **Examine the growth of x_n:**  Determine how quickly $x_n$ increases. This will be important for understanding the size of $y_n$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Sequence y_n:**\n\n*   **Examine the first few terms:**  Calculate $y_1, y_2, y_3, \\ldots$ for small values of $a$ (e.g., $a = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$) to see if we can find a pattern.\n*   **Look for a pattern in primality:**  Determine for which values of $a$ the terms $y_1, y_2, y_3, \\ldots$ are prime.\n*   **Consider the properties of Mersenne primes:**  Since $y_n = 2^{x_n} - 1$, we are dealing with Mersenne numbers.  Mersenne primes are primes of the form $2^p - 1$, where $p$ is a prime.  This might be useful in our analysis.\n\n**4.

        "question": "<input> Let $n$ be a positive integer and fix $2 n$ distinct points on a circumference. Split these points into $n$ pairs and join the points in each pair by an arrow (i.e., an oriented line segment). The resulting configuration is good if no two arrows cross, and there are no arrows $\\overrightarrow{A B}$ and $\\overrightarrow{C D}$ such that $A B C D$ is a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise. Determine the number of good configurations. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Good Configuration Definition:** A configuration is \"good\" if:\n    *   No two arrows cross.\n    *   No two arrows form a clockwise-oriented convex quadrilateral (i.e., no four points A, B, C, D in order around the circle with arrows AB and CD such that the quadrilateral ABCD is oriented clockwise).\n\n**2. Simplify the Problem:**\n\n*   **Focus on Non-Crossing Arrows:** The first condition (no crossing arrows) is similar to the problem of non-crossing matchings. This suggests a connection to Catalan numbers.\n*   **Consider the Clockwise Quadrilateral Condition:** The second condition is more complex. It restricts the orientation of the arrows. We need to find a way to incorporate this condition into our solution.\n\n**3. Explore Small Cases:**\n\n*   **n = 1:** There's only one pair of points. There's only one possible configuration. This is trivially good.\n*   **n = 2:** There are 4 points. We need to consider all possible pairings and check which configurations are good. This will help us identify patterns.\n*   **n = 3:** There are 6 points. This will give us more data to work with.\n\n**4. Consider Catalan Numbers:**\n\n*   **Catalan Numbers and Non-Crossing Matchings:** The number of non-crossing matchings of 2n points on a circle is the nth Catalan number. This is a key concept.\n*   **Relate to the Problem:** The first condition (no crossing arrows) is similar to non-crossing matchings. However, the second condition adds an additional constraint.\n\n**5. Analyze the Clockwise Quadrilateral Condition:**\n\n*   **Clockwise Quadrilateral:** Consider a convex quadrilateral ABCD. The condition prohibits the arrows AB and CD from being oriented clockwise.\n*   **Implications:** This condition restricts the possible orientations of the arrows. It might be helpful to consider the orientation of the arrows in relation to the order of the points on the circle.\n\n**6. Consider the Orientation of Arrows:**\n\n*   **Arrow Orientation:** The arrows are oriented. This means that the direction of the arrow matters.\n*   **Possible Orientations:** For each pair of points, there are two possible orientations for the arrow.\n\n**7. Consider the Total Number of Configurations:**\n\n*   **Total Configurations:** The total number of ways to pair the 2n points and orient the arrows is (2n)! / (2^n n!) * 2^n = (2n)! / n!.\n\n**8. Consider the Good Configurations:**\n\n*   **Good Configurations:** We need to find the number of configurations that satisfy both conditions (no crossing arrows and no clockwise quadrilaterals).\n\n**9. Consider the Relationship Between the Conditions:**\n\n*   **Are the Conditions Independent?** Are the conditions of no crossing arrows and no clockwise quadrilaterals independent? Or is one condition a consequence of the other?\n\n**10. Consider the Final Answer:**\n\n*   **The Answer:** The final answer will be a formula that gives the number of good configurations for a given n. This formula will likely be related to the Catalan numbers.\n\n**11. Consider the Possibility of a Recursive Formula:**\n\n*   **Recursive Structure:** The problem might have a recursive structure. We can try to find a recursive formula for the number of good configurations.\n\n**12. Consider the Possibility of a Combinatorial Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Combinatorial Interpretation:** The problem might have a combinatorial interpretation that can be used to derive the formula.\n\n**13. Consider the Possibility of a Generating Function:**\n\n*   **Generating Function:** A generating function might be helpful in solving the problem.\n\n**14. Consider the Possibility of a Connection to Other Problems:**\n\n*   **Connection to Other Problems:** The problem might be related to other problems in combinatorics, such as the problem of counting non-crossing partitions or the problem of counting non-crossing trees.\n\n**15. Consider the Possibility of a Geometric Interpretation:**\n\n*   **Geometric Interpretation:** The problem might have a geometric interpretation that can be used to visualize the configurations.\n\n**16.

Understand the Problem and Constraints:**\n\n*   **Domino Placement:** Each domino covers two adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically).\n*   **Non-overlapping:** Dominoes cannot overlap.\n*   **No 2x2 Squares:** No two dominoes can form a 2x2 square.\n*   **Bottom Row Coverage:** The bottom row (row m) must be completely covered by dominoes.\n\n**2. Analyze the Bottom Row Coverage:**\n\n*   The bottom row has 2n cells.\n*   Since dominoes are 1x2 or 2x1, the bottom row must be covered by n dominoes.\n*   This means the bottom row is completely covered, and we have a fixed number of dominoes (n) placed horizontally.\n\n**3. Consider the Remaining Rows (Rows 1 to m-1):**\n\n*   We need to place dominoes in the remaining (m-1) rows.\n*   The challenge is to place as many dominoes as possible while avoiding the formation of 2x2 squares.\n\n**4. Key Observations and Strategies:**\n\n*   **Vertical Dominoes:** Placing vertical dominoes in the remaining rows will not form 2x2 squares with the bottom row.\n*   **Horizontal Dominoes:** Placing horizontal dominoes in the remaining rows can potentially form 2x2 squares with the bottom row. We need to be careful with this.\n*   **Alternating Rows:** Consider placing dominoes in a pattern that alternates between horizontal and vertical placements to avoid 2x2 squares.\n*   **Maximizing Coverage:** We want to maximize the number of dominoes placed in the remaining rows.\n\n**5. Develop a Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Place the n dominoes horizontally in the bottom row.\n*   **Step 2:** In the row above the bottom row (row m-1), place vertical dominoes to avoid forming 2x2 squares with the bottom row.\n*   **Step 3:** In the remaining rows (rows 1 to m-2), consider placing dominoes in a pattern that avoids forming 2x2 squares. This could involve alternating between horizontal and vertical placements.\n*   **Step 4:** Calculate the maximum number of dominoes that can be placed in the remaining rows.\n\n**6. Calculate the Maximum Number of Dominoes:**\n\n*   The bottom row has n dominoes.\n*   The row above the bottom row (row m-1) can have (m-1) * 2n / 2 = n(m-1) dominoes.\n*   The remaining rows (rows 1 to m-2) can have a certain number of dominoes, depending on the placement pattern.\n*   The total number of dominoes is the sum of the dominoes in the bottom row, the row above, and the remaining rows.\n\n**7.

Investigate the Function's Properties:**\n\n*   **Monotonicity:**  Try to determine if the function is increasing or decreasing. This can be done by analyzing the difference f(x + f(y)) - f(x + y) and seeing if it's always positive or negative.\n*   **Continuity:**  If we can show that the function is continuous, it will simplify the problem significantly.

Then we always have $k S_{1} \\geq S$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given a convex quadrilateral ABCD.\n*   Points A\u2081, B\u2081, C\u2081, D\u2081 lie on the sides AB, BC, CD, DA respectively.\n*   We are to consider the areas of four triangles: AA\u2081D\u2081, BB\u2081A\u2081, CC\u2081B\u2081, DD\u2081C\u2081.\n*   S is the sum of the two smallest areas among these four triangles.\n*   S\u2081 is the area of quadrilateral A\u2081B\u2081C\u2081D\u2081.\n*   We need to find the smallest positive real number k such that kS\u2081 \u2265 S for any convex quadrilateral and any choice of points A\u2081, B\u2081, C\u2081, D\u2081.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Theorems:**\n\n*   **Area Ratios:** The area of a triangle is proportional to the base and height. This can be used to relate the areas of the triangles to the lengths of segments on the sides of the quadrilateral.\n*   **Mass Point Geometry:** This can be used to find relationships between the areas of the triangles and the ratios of the segments on the sides of the quadrilateral.\n*   **Coordinate Geometry:** Assign coordinates to the vertices of the quadrilateral and use the coordinates to calculate the areas of the triangles and the quadrilateral.\n*   **Inequalities:** We will need to use inequalities to find the smallest k that satisfies the condition for all possible configurations.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Choose a Coordinate System:** Assign coordinates to the vertices of the quadrilateral. This will allow us to calculate the areas of the triangles and the quadrilateral.\n*   **Step 2: Express the Areas:** Express the areas of the triangles AA\u2081D\u2081, BB\u2081A\u2081, CC\u2081B\u2081, DD\u2081C\u2081 in terms of the coordinates of the points and the coordinates of the vertices of the quadrilateral.\n*   **Step 3: Express S\u2081:** Express the area of quadrilateral A\u2081B\u2081C\u2081D\u2081 in terms of the coordinates of the points and the coordinates of the vertices of the quadrilateral.\n*   **Step 4: Find the Ratio S\u2081/S:** Find the ratio of the area of quadrilateral A\u2081B\u2081C\u2081D\u2081 to the sum of the two smallest areas of the triangles.\n*   **Step 5: Find the Minimum Value of k:** Find the minimum value of k such that kS\u2081 \u2265 S for all possible configurations. This will involve finding the maximum value of S\u2081/S and then taking the reciprocal.\n\n**4. Considerations:**\n\n*   The problem states that the inequality must hold for *any* convex quadrilateral and any choice of points A\u2081, B\u2081, C\u2081, D\u2081. This means we need to consider the worst-case scenario.\n*   We should consider special cases, such as when the quadrilateral is a square, a rectangle, a parallelogram, or a trapezoid. These cases can help us find the maximum value of S\u2081/S.\n*   We should also consider the case where the points A\u2081, B\u2081, C\u2081, D\u2081 divide the sides of the quadrilateral in specific ratios. This can help us find the maximum value of S\u2081/S.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer will be the smallest positive real number k that satisfies the inequality kS\u2081 \u2265 S for all possible configurations of the quadrilateral and the points A\u2081, B\u2081, C\u2081, D\u2081.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

        "question": "<input> Find all pairs $(k, n)$ of positive integers for which $7^{k}-3^{n}$ divides $k^{4}+n^{2}$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given a divisibility condition: $7^k - 3^n$ divides $k^4 + n^2$.\n*   We need to find all pairs of positive integers $(k, n)$ that satisfy this condition.\n\n**2. Consider Small Values:**\n\n*   Start by testing small values of $k$ and $n$ (e.g., $k = 1, 2, 3$ and $n = 1, 2, 3$) to see if we can find any solutions.\n*   Calculate $7^k - 3^n$ and $k^4 + n^2$ for these values.\n*   Check if $7^k - 3^n$ divides $k^4 + n^2$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Divisibility Condition:**\n\n*   The condition $7^k - 3^n \\mid k^4 + n^2$ implies that $k^4 + n^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7^k - 3^n}$.\n*   This means $k^4 + n^2$ is a multiple of $7^k - 3^n$.\n\n**4. Consider Modulo Arithmetic:**\n\n*   Since $7^k - 3^n$ divides $k^4 + n^2$, we can write $k^4 + n^2 = m(7^k - 3^n)$ for some integer $m$.\n*   This gives us $k^4 + n^2 + m(3^n) = m(7^k)$.\n*   We can analyze this equation modulo 7 and 3 to find constraints on $k$ and $n$.\n\n**5. Consider the Growth of the Functions:**\n\n*   Note that $7^k$ grows much faster than $k^4$ and $3^n$ grows much faster than $n^2$.\n*   This suggests that for large values of $k$ and $n$, $7^k - 3^n$ will be much larger than $k^4 + n^2$, making it unlikely for the divisibility condition to hold.\n*   This implies that the solutions are likely to be small values of $k$ and $n$.\n\n**6. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT):**\n\n*   If we can find constraints on $k$ and $n$ modulo 7 and 3, we can use CRT to find possible values of $k$ and $n$.\n\n**7. Consider the Possibility of a General Solution:**\n\n*   If we can find a general solution for $k$ and $n$, we can use it to find all possible solutions.\n*   If not, we can use the constraints from the previous steps to narrow down the possible values of $k$ and $n$.\n\n**8. Verify the Solutions:**\n\n*   Once we have potential solutions, we need to verify that they satisfy the original divisibility condition.\n\n**9.

Key Observations and Concepts:**\n\n*   **Napkin Coverage:** Each napkin covers a 52x52 area. This means that a single napkin can cover up to 52*52 = 2704 cells.\n*   **Overlap Consideration:** Napkins can overlap. The challenge is to arrange them to maximize the number of cells with the same nonzero count.\n*   **Nonzero Count:** We are only interested in cells with a nonzero number of napkins covering them.\n*   **Maximizing k:** We want to maximize the number of cells with the same nonzero count.

Each country has a flag $N$ units wide and one unit high composed of $N$ fields of size $1 \\times 1$, each field being either yellow or blue. No two countries have the same flag.\n\nWe say that a set of $N$ flags is diverse if these flags can be arranged into an $N \\times N$ square so that all $N$ fields on its main diagonal will have the same color. Determine the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags, there exist $N$ flags forming a diverse set. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Flags:** Each flag is a sequence of N yellow (Y) or blue (B) fields. There are 2^N possible flags.\n*   **Diverse Set:** A set of N flags can be arranged in an N x N square such that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is all yellow or all blue.\n*   **Goal:** Find the smallest M such that any collection of M distinct flags must contain a diverse set.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Theorems:**\n\n*   **Pigeonhole Principle:** If you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n*   **Combinatorics:** Counting and analyzing combinations of flags.\n*   **Graph Theory (Optional):** Consider flags as vertices and edges representing compatibility (can be arranged to form a diverse set). We want to find the minimum number of vertices that guarantees a complete subgraph of size N.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Consider the Complement:** Instead of directly finding a diverse set, consider the opposite: what is the maximum number of flags we can have without having a diverse set?\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Diagonal:** The main diagonal of the square must be all yellow or all blue. This means that for a diverse set, we need to find N flags that can be arranged such that the diagonal is monochromatic.\n*   **Step 3: Consider the Diagonal Fields:** For each flag, consider the color of the field in the position that would be on the diagonal if the flag were placed in a specific row. For example, if we want the diagonal to be yellow, we need to find flags where the field in position 1 is yellow, the field in position 2 is yellow, etc.\n*   **Step 4: Use the Pigeonhole Principle:** If we have too many flags, we must have a set of flags that can be arranged to form a diverse set.\n*   **Step 5: Consider the Worst-Case Scenario:** What is the maximum number of flags we can have without having a diverse set? This will help us determine the minimum M.\n*   **Step 6: Generalize:** Try to find a pattern or formula that can be generalized for any N.\n\n**4. Potential Approaches:**\n\n*   **Constructive Approach:** Try to construct a set of flags that does not contain a diverse set. This will help us understand the maximum number of flags we can have without a diverse set.\n*   **Combinatorial Argument:** Use combinatorics to count the number of possible flags and the number of possible diverse sets.\n*   **Graph Theory Approach:** Model the problem as a graph and use graph theory concepts to find the minimum M.\n\n**5. Expected Solution:**\n\nThe solution will likely involve a clever application of the pigeonhole principle and combinatorics. The final answer will be a formula or a specific number that depends on N.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

(Two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are supposed to be different.) </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem Constraints:**\n\n*   **(i) No two kings can be adjacent:** This means that no two kings can be placed in squares that share a common side or a common vertex.  This is a key constraint that will limit the possible arrangements.\n*   **(ii) Each row and column must contain exactly 25 kings:** This is a crucial constraint that will help us determine the number of possible arrangements.\n\n**2. Consider the Chessboard and King Placement:**\n\n*   The chessboard is a 100x100 grid.\n*   A king can move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).  Therefore, placing a king in a square restricts the placement of other kings in the surrounding squares.\n*   The constraint that no two kings can be adjacent means that we need to find a way to place the kings such that there is at least one square between them in all directions.\n\n**3. Consider the Row and Column Constraints:**\n\n*   Each row must contain exactly 25 kings.  This means that in each row, we need to place 25 kings in such a way that they are not adjacent to each other.\n*   Similarly, each column must contain exactly 25 kings.\n\n**4. Consider the Implications of the Constraints:**\n\n*   The constraints (i) and (ii) are interdependent.  The placement of kings in one row will affect the placement of kings in the adjacent rows and columns.\n*   The problem is asking for the number of arrangements, not the number of possible placements.  This means that we need to consider the different ways to satisfy the constraints.\n\n**5. Consider Possible Strategies:**\n\n*   **Combinatorics:** We can use combinatorics to calculate the number of ways to place the kings in each row and column, while ensuring that the adjacency constraint is satisfied.\n*   **Graph Theory:** We can model the chessboard as a graph, where each square is a node and edges connect squares that are adjacent.  The problem then becomes finding the number of independent sets of size 2500 in this graph.\n*   **Symmetry and Rotations:** The problem states that arrangements that differ by rotation or symmetry are considered different.  This means that we need to consider all possible arrangements, even those that are symmetric to each other.\n\n**6. Consider the Complexity of the Problem:**\n\n*   The problem is likely to be very complex.  The number of possible arrangements is likely to be extremely large.\n*   The problem may require the use of advanced mathematical techniques, such as combinatorics, graph theory, and possibly even computer algorithms.\n\n**7. Consider the Final Answer:**\n\n*   The final answer will be the number of arrangements that satisfy the given constraints.\n*   The answer will likely be a very large number, possibly involving factorials or powers.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Consider Small Values of n:**\n\n*   Start by testing small nonnegative integer values of $n$ (e.g., $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$) and see if we can find corresponding values of $m$ that satisfy the equation.\n*   This will help identify potential patterns or constraints.\n\n**3. Rearrange the Equation:**\n\n*   Rearrange the equation to isolate $m$ or $m^2$ on one side.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the smallest number `n` such that the polynomial `x^2 + 7` can be expressed as the sum of `n` squares of polynomials with rational coefficients.\n*   The key is to determine the minimum number of squares required to represent the given polynomial.\n\n**2. Consider the Nature of Squares:**\n\n*   The square of a polynomial with rational coefficients will always have even exponents for the variable `x` (e.g., `x^2`, `x^4`, etc.).\n*   The sum of squares will also have even exponents for `x`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Polynomial:**\n\n*   The given polynomial is `x^2 + 7`. This has an odd exponent for `x` (1) and a constant term (7).\n*   This suggests that we need to consider the possibility of using squares of linear polynomials (e.g., `ax + b`) to generate the `x^2` term.\n\n**4. Consider the Case of n=1:**\n\n*   Can `x^2 + 7` be written as the square of a single polynomial with rational coefficients?  This would require `x^2 + 7 = (ax + b)^2`.  Expanding the right-hand side and comparing coefficients would show that this is not possible.\n\n**5. Consider the Case of n=2:**\n\n*   Can `x^2 + 7` be written as the sum of two squares of polynomials with rational coefficients?  This would require `x^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2`.  We can try to find such polynomials `f_1(x)` and `f_2(x)`.  If this is not possible, we can move on to n=3.\n\n**6.

If this is possible, then we have found the smallest `n`.\n\n**8. General Strategy:**\n\n*   For each value of `n` starting from 1, try to find polynomials `f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., f_n(x)` with rational coefficients such that `x^2 + 7 = f_1(x)^2 + f_2(x)^2 + ... + f_n(x)^2`.\n*   If such polynomials exist for a particular `n`, then that is the smallest possible value of `n`.\n\n**9.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given a positive integer `n`.\n*   We need to find the minimum value of a specific expression involving the floor function.\n*   The expression is the sum of floor values of the form `floor(a_i / i)` for `i` from 1 to `n`.\n*   The variables `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a permutation of the numbers `1, 2, ..., n`.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Observations:**\n\n*   **Permutations:** The values `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a rearrangement of the numbers `1, 2, ..., n`.\n*   **Floor Function:** The floor function `floor(x)` returns the greatest integer less than or equal to `x`.\n*   **Strategy:** We need to find a way to assign the numbers `1, 2, ..., n` to the positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that the sum of the floor values is minimized.\n*   **Intuition:** To minimize the sum, we want to minimize the value of each term `floor(a_i / i)`. This suggests that we want to assign smaller numbers to positions with larger denominators (i.e., larger `i` values).\n\n**3. Strategy Development:**\n\n*   **Initial Assignment:** Start by assigning the smallest numbers to the largest denominators. For example, assign `1` to `a_n`, `2` to `a_{n-1}`, and so on.\n*   **Evaluate the Sum:** Calculate the sum of the floor values for this initial assignment.\n*   **Refinement:** Consider if swapping values between positions can lead to a smaller sum. For example, if `floor(a_i / i) + floor(a_j / j) > floor(a_j / i) + floor(a_i / j)`, then swapping `a_i` and `a_j` would decrease the sum.\n*   **Generalization:** Try to find a pattern or a general rule for assigning numbers to positions to minimize the sum.\n\n**4. Implementation:**\n\n*   **Iterative Approach:** Start with the initial assignment and iteratively swap values to see if the sum can be reduced.\n*   **Optimization:** Continue swapping until no further improvements can be made.\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Look for a pattern in the optimal assignments and the resulting sum.\n\n**5. Verification:**\n\n*   **Small Cases:** Test the strategy with small values of `n` (e.g., n=1, 2, 3, 4) to verify its correctness.\n*   **General Case:** Try to generalize the pattern observed in the small cases to larger values of `n`.\n*   **Formal Proof (Optional):** If possible, provide a formal proof to justify the strategy and the resulting minimum sum.\n\n**6. Final Answer:**\n\n*   State the minimum value of the sum for a given `n` based on the strategy and observations.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Strategy:**\n\n*   **Start with Small Values of `n`:** Begin by testing small values of `n` (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) and check if they satisfy the condition.\n*   **Analyze the Divisors:** For each `n`, list all its divisors and consider different permutations of these divisors.\n*   **Check the Sum Condition:** For each permutation, calculate the cumulative sum of the first `i` divisors and check if it's a perfect square.\n*   **Look for Patterns:** Observe if there's a pattern in the values of `n` that satisfy the condition.\n*   **Consider the Number of Divisors:** The number of divisors `k` is crucial. The sum of the first `k` divisors must be a perfect square.\n*   **Use the Divisor Function:** If a pattern emerges, try to generalize it using the divisor function and properties of perfect squares.\n*   **Formulate a General Rule:** If a pattern is found, try to formulate a general rule or formula that determines which values of `n` satisfy the condition.\n\n**4.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the value(s) of `q` such that, for any set of ten distinct real numbers, the second line of numbers (generated by `qab`) is a subset of the third line of numbers (generated by `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 - d\u00b2`).\n\n**2. Analyze the First Line:**\n\n*   The first line contains all possible differences of pairs of numbers from the napkin. This means the first line contains all possible values of `a - b` where `a` and `b` are from the set of ten numbers.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Line:**\n\n*   The second line contains all possible values of `qab` where `a` and `b` are from the first line. This means the second line contains all possible values of `q(a - b)(c - d)` where `a, b, c, d` are from the set of ten numbers.\n\n**4. Analyze the Third Line:**\n\n*   The third line contains all possible values of `a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 - d\u00b2` where `a, b, c, d` are from the set of ten numbers.\n\n**5. Key Insight:**\n\n*   The crucial observation is that the third line can be rewritten as `(a\u00b2 - c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - d\u00b2)`. This can be factored as `(a - c)(a + c) + (b - d)(b + d)`. This suggests a connection between the second and third lines.\n\n**6. Consider Specific Cases:**\n\n*   Try to find a relationship between the second line and the third line by considering specific values for the numbers on the napkin. For example, consider the case where the numbers on the napkin are all zero. This will simplify the expressions and help identify potential values of `q`.\n\n**7. General Case:**\n\n*   Consider the general case where the numbers on the napkin are arbitrary. Try to express the second line in terms of the third line. This might involve manipulating the expressions and using algebraic identities.\n\n**8.

This way, we get $3 n$ sets of colors, split into three groups according to the orientation. It happens that for every set in any group, the same set appears in both of the other groups. Determine, in terms of $n$, the maximal possible number of colors that are present. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Cube Structure:** We have an n x n x n cube made of unit cubes.\n*   **Coloring:** Each unit cube is painted with one color.\n*   **Box Definition:** A box is an n x n x 1 slice of the cube, which can be oriented along the x, y, or z-axis.\n*   **Color Sets:** For each box, we create a set of colors present in that box (without duplicates).\n*   **Grouping:** The 3n boxes are grouped into three groups based on their orientation (x, y, z).\n*   **Key Condition:** For every set in any group, the same set appears in both of the other groups.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the maximum number of colors that can be used under these conditions.\n\n**2.

Strategy:**\n\n*   **Consider the Color Sets:** Let S be the set of colors in the cube. The condition implies that the color sets of all boxes are the same. Let's call this common set C.\n*   **Analyze the Color Sets:** Since each box is an n x n x 1 slice, the color set C must contain at least n colors (one for each row/column in the slice).\n*   **Consider the Unit Cubes:** Each unit cube belongs to three different boxes.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the smallest positive integer `n` such that there are infinitely many distinct `n`-tuples of positive rational numbers `(a1, a2, ..., an)` satisfying two conditions:\n    *   The sum `a1 + a2 + ... + an` is an integer.\n    *   The sum `1/a1 + 1/a2 + ... + 1/an` is also an integer.\n\n**2. Consider Small Values of n:**\n\n*   **n = 1:**  This is trivial.  The only possible `1-tuple` is `(a1)`.  The sum `a1` is an integer, and the sum `1/a1` is an integer only if `a1 = 1`.  So, there's only one such `1-tuple`.  Not infinitely many.\n*   **n = 2:**  We need to find infinitely many pairs `(a1, a2)` of positive rational numbers such that `a1 + a2` and `1/a1 + 1/a2` are integers.  We can try to find a pattern or a construction that generates infinitely many such pairs.\n*   **n = 3:**  Similar to the n=2 case, we need to find infinitely many triples `(a1, a2, a3)` of positive rational numbers such that the sum and the reciprocal sum are integers.  We can try to find a pattern or a construction that generates infinitely many such triples.\n\n**3. Generalize the Approach:**\n\n*   For a general `n`, we need to find a way to construct infinitely many `n`-tuples of positive rational numbers such that the sum and the reciprocal sum are integers.\n*   We can consider using a common denominator for the rational numbers.  For example, we can choose all the `ai` to be rational numbers with the same denominator.  This might help in ensuring that the sum and the reciprocal sum are integers.\n*   We can also consider using a parameter to generate different `n`-tuples.  For example, we can set `a1 = k` and `a2 = 1/k` for some rational number `k`.  This would ensure that the sum `a1 + a2 = k + 1/k` and the reciprocal sum `1/a1 + 1/a2 = 1/k + k` are both integers if `k` is an integer.  We can then try to generalize this idea for larger `n`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Conditions:**\n\n*   The sum `a1 + a2 + ... + an` being an integer implies that the sum of the numerators of the rational numbers (when expressed with a common denominator) must be divisible by the common denominator.\n*   The reciprocal sum `1/a1 + 1/a2 + ... + 1/an` being an integer implies that the sum of the denominators of the rational numbers (when expressed with a common denominator) must be divisible by the common denominator.\n\n**5. Consider the Relationship Between the Conditions:**\n\n*   The two conditions are related.  The sum and the reciprocal sum being integers impose constraints on the possible values of the `ai`.\n*   We can try to find a relationship between the sum and the reciprocal sum.  For example, we can consider the product of the sum and the reciprocal sum.\n\n**6. Try to Find a Pattern or Construction:**\n\n*   We can try to find a pattern or a construction that generates infinitely many `n`-tuples of positive rational numbers that satisfy the two conditions.\n*   We can try to find a way to parameterize the `ai` such that the sum and the reciprocal sum are integers.\n\n**7. Consider the Possibility of No Solution:**\n\n*   We need to consider the possibility that no such `n` exists.  This would mean that for all positive integers `n`, there are only finitely many `n`-tuples of positive rational numbers that satisfy the two conditions.\n\n**8. Conclusion:**\n\n*   Based on the analysis, we can determine whether such an `n` exists and find the smallest such `n` if it does.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understanding the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given five positive real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$.\n*   We need to find the smallest constant $C$ such that for any choice of these numbers, there exist distinct indices $i, j, k, l$ (i.e., $i \\neq j, k, l$ and $j \\neq k, l$ and $k \\neq l$) satisfying the inequality $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}| \\leq C$.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Strategies:**\n\n*   **Ordering:** Consider ordering the numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$ in increasing order. This will help us analyze the ratios.\n*   **Ratios:** The expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}|$ represents the absolute difference between two ratios. We want to minimize the maximum possible value of this difference.\n*   **Extremal Cases:** Consider cases where the numbers are equal, or where the numbers are in geometric progression. These cases often help in finding the maximum or minimum values.\n*   **Bounding:** Try to find an upper bound for the expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}|$ in terms of the numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$.\n*   **Optimization:** Use the ordering of the numbers to find the maximum possible value of the expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}|$.\n*   **Proof by Contradiction:** Assume that $C$ is smaller than the value we suspect to be the answer, and try to find a contradiction.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Plan:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Order the Numbers:** Let $a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq a_3 \\leq a_4 \\leq a_5$.\n*   **Step 2: Consider Extremal Cases:**\n    *   Case 1: All numbers are equal. In this case, the expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}| = 0$.\n    *   Case 2: The numbers are in geometric progression. For example, $a_1 = 1, a_2 = r, a_3 = r^2, a_4 = r^3, a_5 = r^4$ for some $r > 1$. Analyze the expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}|$ in this case.\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Expression:** Consider the expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}|$. Try to find an upper bound for this expression in terms of the numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$.\n*   **Step 4: Find the Maximum Value:** Use the ordering of the numbers and the results from Step 3 to find the maximum possible value of the expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}|$.\n*   **Step 5: Determine the Value of C:** The maximum value found in Step 4 will be the value of $C$.\n*   **Step 6: Prove Optimality:** Show that the value of $C$ found in Step 5 is indeed the smallest possible value. This can be done by showing that for any smaller value of $C$, there exists a choice of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$ such that the inequality $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}| \\leq C$ is not satisfied.\n\n**4. Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   The problem is asking for the smallest real constant $C$, so we need to be careful to find the tightest possible bound.\n*   The problem states that the subscripts $i, j, k, l$ must be distinct. This means that we cannot use the same number more than once in the expression $|\\frac{a_i}{a_j} - \\frac{a_k}{a_l}|$.\n*   The problem is asking for a constant $C$ that works for any choice of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$. This means that we need to find a value of $C$ that is independent of the specific values of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understand the Given Condition:**\n\n*   The condition $(a+c)(b+d)=ac+bd$ is crucial.  We need to manipulate this equation to find relationships between the variables.\n\n**2. Expand and Simplify the Given Condition:**\n\n*   Expand the left-hand side of the equation: $(a+c)(b+d) = ab + ad + bc + cd$.\n*   Set this equal to the right-hand side: $ab + ad + bc + cd = ac + bd$.\n*   Rearrange the equation to group like terms: $ab + ad + bc + cd - ac - bd = 0$.\n*   Factor the equation if possible.  This might involve grouping terms or looking for common factors.\n\n**3. Analyze the Simplified Equation:**\n\n*   The simplified equation should reveal some relationships between the variables.

We need to find a way to relate it to the condition we derived in step 2.\n\n**5. Apply Inequalities (AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz):**\n\n*   The AM-GM inequality is a good candidate for minimizing expressions involving sums of fractions.  The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality might also be useful.\n*   Consider applying AM-GM to the terms of $S$ or to the terms of the simplified condition.\n\n**6. Substitute or Express Variables in Terms of Others:**\n\n*   If the simplified condition allows us to express one variable in terms of others, substitute that expression into the expression for $S$.\n*   This might reduce the number of variables in the expression for $S$.\n\n**7. Find the Minimum Value:**\n\n*   After simplifying and applying inequalities, we should be able to find the minimum value of $S$.\n*   The minimum value will likely be a constant, and we need to verify that it is achievable (i.e., there exist positive real numbers $a, b, c, d$ that satisfy the given condition and achieve this minimum value).\n\n**8.

        "question": "<input> Let $n$ be a positive integer. Harry has $n$ coins lined up on his desk, each showing heads or tails. He repeatedly does the following operation: if there are $k$ coins showing heads and $k>0$, then he flips the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin over; otherwise he stops the process. (For example, the process starting with THT would be THT $\\rightarrow H H T \\rightarrow H T T \\rightarrow T T T$, which takes three steps.)\n\nLetting $C$ denote the initial configuration (a sequence of $n H$ 's and $T$ 's), write $\\ell(C)$ for the number of steps needed before all coins show $T$. Show that this number $\\ell(C)$ is finite, and determine its average value over all $2^{n}$ possible initial configurations $C$. </input>\n\n# Solution to the Coin Flipping Problem\n\n## **1. Showing that $\\ell(C)$ is finite**\n\nWe are given a process where:\n\n- We start with a configuration $C$ of $n$ coins, each showing either heads (H) or tails (T).\n- In each step, if there are $k$ heads, we flip the $k^{\\text{th}}$ coin.\n- The process stops when all coins show tails (T).\n\nWe need to show that the number of steps $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Finite State Space:**  \n   There are only $2^n$ possible configurations of $n$ coins (each coin can be H or T). This is a finite number.\n\n2. **Monotonicity of the Process:**  \n   - The process is deterministic.\n   - Each step changes the configuration.\n   - The process must eventually reach a configuration with all tails (T), because the number of heads is finite and the process is guaranteed to reduce the number of heads over time.\n\n3. **Termination:**  \n   - The process stops when all coins are tails.\n   - Since the number of heads is finite and the process reduces the number of heads (or keeps it the same), the process must eventually terminate.\n\n4. **No Cycles:**  \n   - The process cannot cycle through configurations because the number of heads is finite and the process is deterministic.\n   - If the process were to cycle, it would imply that the number of heads is not decreasing, which contradicts the rules of the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nSince the process is deterministic, the number of heads is finite, and the process must eventually reach a configuration with all tails, we conclude that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Determining the Average Value of $\\ell(C)$**\n\nWe now compute the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Define the Average**\n\nLet $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_{2^n}$ be the $2^n$ possible configurations of $n$ coins.  \nLet $\\ell(C_i)$ be the number of steps needed to reach all tails for configuration $C_i$.\n\nThen, the average value of $\\ell(C)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{i=1}^{2^n} \\ell(C_i)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Consider the Process in Terms of Heads**\n\nLet\u2019s define a function $f(C)$ that counts the number of heads in configuration $C$. Then, the process can be viewed as a function that reduces the number of heads.\n\nLet\u2019s define a new function $g(C)$, which is the number of steps needed to reach all tails from configuration $C$.\n\nWe want to compute:\n\n$$\n\\text{Average} = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{C} g(C)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Use Linearity of Expectation**\n\nLet\u2019s define a random variable $X$ that represents the number of steps needed to reach all tails from a randomly chosen configuration $C$.\n\nThen, the average value of $\\ell(C)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\frac{1}{2^n} \\sum_{C} g(C)\n$$\n\nWe can compute this expectation by considering the expected number of steps for each coin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Consider the Expected Number of Steps for Each Coin**\n\nLet\u2019s define a random variable $X_i$ that is 1 if the $i^{\\text{th}}$ coin is flipped in the process, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThen, the total number of steps is:\n\n$$\nX = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\n$$\n\nSo, the expected number of steps is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbb{E}[X_i]\n$$\n\nNow, we compute $\\mathbb{E}[X_i]$, the expected number of times the $i^{\\text{th}}$ coin is flipped.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Compute $\\mathbb{E}[X_i]$**\n\nLet\u2019s consider the $i^{\\text{th}}$ coin. It is flipped in the process if and only if the number of heads in the configuration is at least $i$.\n\nLet\u2019s define a random variable $H$ that represents the number of heads in the configuration. Then, the $i^{\\text{th}}$ coin is flipped if and only if $H \\geq i$.\n\nSo, the expected number of times the $i^{\\text{th}}$ coin is flipped is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\Pr(H \\geq i)\n$$\n\nNow, we compute $\\Pr(H \\geq i)$.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Compute $\\Pr(H \\geq i)$**\n\nLet\u2019s define a random variable $H$ that represents the number of heads in a random configuration of $n$ coins. Then, $H$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSo, the probability that $H = k$ is:\n\n$$\n\\Pr(H = k) = \\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n$$\n\nThen, the probability that $H \\geq i$ is:\n\n$$\n\\Pr(H \\geq i) = \\sum_{k=i}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n$$\n\nSo, the expected number of times the $i^{\\text{th}}$ coin is flipped is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \\sum_{k=i}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: Compute the Total Expected Number of Steps**\n\nNow, the expected number of steps is:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{k=i}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n$$\n\nWe can switch the order of summation:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\binom{n}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\binom{n}{k}\n$$\n\nNow, we use the identity:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} k \\binom{n}{k} = n \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \\binom{n}{k} = n \\cdot 2^{n-1}\n$$\n\nTherefore,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\cdot n \\cdot 2^{n-1} = n \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{Average value of } \\ell(C) = \\frac{n}{2}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\n- We have shown that $\\ell(C)$ is finite for any initial configuration $C$.\n- We have computed the average value of $\\ell(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible configurations, and it is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}\n$$\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understand the Problem and Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Labyrinth Structure:** A labyrinth with `n` walls, each an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls intersect at a single point.\n*   **Painting:** Each wall has a red and blue side.\n*   **Intersections:** At each intersection of two walls, there are four corners. Two diagonally opposite corners have red and blue sides, and the other two have two red or two blue sides.\n*   **Doors:** Two-way doors connect the diagonally opposite corners with different colored sides.\n*   **Knights:** Can move through doors but not through walls.\n*   **Goal:** Determine the maximum number `k(L)` such that, regardless of how Merlin paints the walls, Morgana can always place at least `k` knights in the labyrinth such that no two knights can ever meet.\n\n**2. Simplify the Problem:**\n\n*   **Graph Representation:** Model the labyrinth as a graph. Each intersection is a vertex. Each door is an edge. The red and blue sides of the walls can be represented as colors on the edges.\n*   **Knight Placement:** The problem becomes finding the maximum number of knights that can be placed on the graph such that no two knights are connected by an edge (i.e., no two knights can meet).\n\n**3. Key Observations and Theorems:**\n\n*   **Graph Theory:** The problem is related to graph coloring and independent sets.\n*   **Independent Set:** An independent set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. The size of the largest independent set is the key to solving the problem.\n*   **Bipartite Graphs:** The graph formed by the labyrinth is bipartite. This is because the doors connect only diagonally opposite corners with different colored sides. This means the graph can be divided into two sets of vertices (red and blue) such that no two vertices within the same set are connected.\n*   **Bipartite Graph Properties:** In a bipartite graph, the size of the largest independent set is equal to the number of vertices in the smaller of the two partitions.\n\n**4. Determine the Value of k(L):**\n\n*   **Number of Vertices:** The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the number of intersections, which is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.\n*   **Partition Sizes:** The graph is bipartite, so the vertices can be divided into two sets. The size of the smaller set is the floor of C(n, 2)/2.\n*   **Maximum Independent Set:** The size of the largest independent set is equal to the size of the smaller partition.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The value of `k(L)` is the floor of C(n, 2)/2, which is floor(n(n-1)/4).\n*   Therefore, for each `n`, the possible value of `k(L)` is floor(n(n-1)/4).\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

        "question": "<input> For any two different real numbers $x$ and $y$, we define $D(x, y)$ to be the unique integer $d$ satisfying $2^{d} \\leqslant|x-y|<2^{d+1}$. Given a set of reals $\\mathcal{F}$, and an element $x \\in \\mathcal{F}$, we say that the scales of $x$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ are the values of $D(x, y)$ for $y \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with $x \\neq y$.\n\nLet $k$ be a given positive integer. Suppose that each member $x$ of $\\mathcal{F}$ has at most $k$ different scales in $\\mathcal{F}$ (note that these scales may depend on $x$ ). What is the maximum possible size of $\\mathcal{F}$ ? </input>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **D(x, y):** This function measures the \"scale\" of the difference between two real numbers. It essentially determines the power of 2 that is just less than or equal to the absolute difference between x and y.\n*   **Scales of x in F:** For a given x in the set F, the scales of x are the values of D(x, y) for all other elements y in F.\n*   **Constraint:** Each element x in F has at most k different scales in F.\n*   **Goal:** Find the maximum possible size of the set F.\n\n**2. Consider Small Cases and Patterns:**\n\n*   **k = 1:** If each element has only one scale, then all elements must be at the same distance from each other. This suggests a geometric progression or a set of equally spaced points.\n*   **k = 2:** If each element has two scales, then the set F can be structured in a way that elements are at two different distances from each other. This might involve a combination of geometric progressions or a more complex structure.\n*   **General k:** Try to find a pattern or a general construction that allows for k different scales per element.\n\n**3. Explore Possible Constructions:**\n\n*   **Geometric Progression:** Consider a set of numbers in a geometric progression. This might naturally lead to a limited number of scales.\n*   **Binary Tree Structure:** Think about how the scales relate to the binary representation of distances. A binary tree structure might help organize the elements and their scales.\n*   **Recursive Construction:** Build the set F recursively, ensuring that each new element added has at most k scales.\n\n**4. Analyze the Scales and Their Implications:**\n\n*   **Scale Distribution:** For a given x, the scales D(x, y) for y in F are determined by the distances between x and y. The constraint that each x has at most k scales implies a restriction on the possible distances between elements.\n*   **Distance Constraints:** The scales D(x, y) = d imply that the distance between x and y is in the interval [2^d, 2^{d+1}). This can be used to derive constraints on the possible distances between elements.\n\n**5. Consider the Maximum Size of F:**\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** Try to find an upper bound on the size of F. This could be based on the number of possible scales and the constraints on distances.\n*   **Lower Bound:** Try to construct a set F that satisfies the conditions and has a certain size. This will help determine the lower bound.\n*   **Optimality:** Determine if the constructed set F achieves the upper bound or if there's a way to improve it.\n\n**6. Generalize and Conclude:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Look for a pattern in the constructions and constraints.\n*   **Formulate a General Rule:** Based on the analysis, formulate a general rule or formula for the maximum size of F in terms of k.\n*   **State the Answer:** Clearly state the maximum possible size of F.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the minimum value of `n` such that there exists a set of `n` positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions.\n*   A good partition is defined as a division of the set into two non-empty subsets where the LCM of one subset equals the GCD of the other.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Observations:**\n\n*   **LCM and GCD:** The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number divisible by all the numbers in the set. The GCD is the largest number that divides all the numbers in the set.\n*   **Good Partition Condition:** For a partition to be good, the LCM of one subset must equal the GCD of the other. This implies a strong relationship between the elements of the set.\n*   **Prime Factorization:** The LCM and GCD of a set of numbers are closely related to the prime factorization of the numbers. This suggests that the prime factorization of the elements in the set will play a crucial role.\n*   **Divisors and Multiples:** The GCD of a set of numbers is a divisor of all the numbers in the set. The LCM of a set of numbers is a multiple of all the numbers in the set.\n*   **Partitioning:** The number of good partitions is related to the number of ways we can divide the set into two subsets that satisfy the LCM-GCD condition.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Prime Factorization Approach:** Consider the prime factorization of the elements in the set. The LCM and GCD conditions will be satisfied if the elements have a specific relationship in terms of their prime factors.\n*   **Divisor Analysis:** Analyze the divisors of the elements in the set. The GCD of a subset will be a divisor of the LCM of the other subset.\n*   **Counting Good Partitions:** Determine how the prime factorization and divisor relationships affect the number of good partitions. This will likely involve counting the number of ways to divide the set into subsets that satisfy the LCM-GCD condition.\n*   **Minimizing `n`:** Find the smallest possible value of `n` that allows for exactly 2015 good partitions. This may involve finding a set of numbers with a specific prime factorization that allows for the required number of good partitions.\n\n**4. Implementation Steps:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Prime Factorization and Divisor Relationships:** Analyze the prime factorization of the elements in the set. Determine how the prime factors can be distributed among the subsets to satisfy the LCM-GCD condition.\n*   **Step 2: Counting Good Partitions:** Develop a method to count the number of good partitions based on the prime factorization and divisor relationships.\n*   **Step 3: Optimization:** Find the smallest possible value of `n` that allows for exactly 2015 good partitions. This may involve trying different prime factorizations and counting the number of good partitions for each.\n*   **Step 4: Verification:** Verify that the chosen set of numbers with the calculated `n` indeed has exactly 2015 good partitions.\n\n**5. Expected Outcome:**\n\n*   The final answer will be the minimum value of `n` such that there exists a set of `n` positive integers with exactly 2015 good partitions.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Find the greatest positive integer $k$ such that for every happy configuration of rooks, we can find a $k \\times k$ square without a rook on any of its $k^{2}$ unit squares. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Happy Configuration:** A configuration of $n$ rooks on an $n \\times n$ chessboard where each row and column contains exactly one rook. This is equivalent to a permutation matrix.\n*   **Goal:** Find the largest integer $k$ such that, for any happy configuration, there exists a $k \\times k$ square that contains no rooks.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Observations:**\n\n*   **Permutation Matrix:** A happy configuration is a permutation matrix. This means the rook positions correspond to a permutation of the numbers $1$ to $n$.\n*   **Square without Rooks:** We need to find a $k \\times k$ subgrid (not necessarily aligned with the board's edges) that contains no rooks.\n*   **Complementary Problem:** Instead of looking for a square without rooks, consider the complement: the rooks divide the board into regions. We want to find the largest square that can fit in the \"empty\" space.\n*   **Worst-Case Scenario:** We need to consider the configuration of rooks that makes it most difficult to find a large square without rooks. This is likely a configuration where the rooks are spread out as evenly as possible.\n*   **Geometric Considerations:** The placement of rooks affects the size of the largest square that can be found. The rooks block certain areas, and the spacing between them determines the size of the largest possible square.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Construct a Worst-Case Configuration:** Consider a configuration where the rooks are placed in a way that maximizes the difficulty of finding a large square without rooks. This might involve placing rooks in a checkerboard pattern or spreading them out evenly.\n*   **Analyze the Worst-Case Configuration:** Determine the largest square that can be found in this configuration. This will give us a lower bound for $k$.\n*   **Consider Other Configurations:** Try to find configurations where the largest square without rooks is smaller than the lower bound found in the worst-case scenario. This will help us determine an upper bound for $k$.\n*   **Use Combinatorial Arguments:** Consider the number of rooks and how they divide the board. Use this to reason about the size of the largest square that can be found.\n*   **Consider the Complement:** Instead of focusing on the rooks, consider the empty spaces. How many empty spaces are there? How can they be arranged to form a square?\n\n**4. Potential Theorems and Concepts:**\n\n*   **Pigeonhole Principle:** This might be useful in proving that a certain size of square must exist.\n*   **Combinatorics:** The number of rooks and the number of squares on the board are important.\n*   **Graph Theory:** The rook positions can be represented as a graph, and the problem might be related to finding a subgraph with certain properties.\n*   **Geometry:** The placement of rooks and the size of the square are geometrically related.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The final answer will be a specific integer $k$ that satisfies the conditions of the problem.\n*   The value of $k$ will likely be related to $n$ in a simple way, such as $k = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$ or $k = \\lfloor \\frac{n}{3} \\rfloor$.\n*   The answer will be derived from the analysis of the worst-case configuration and the use of combinatorial and geometric arguments.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

        "question": "<input> We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a real number on it. For every real number $x$, there is exactly one card in the deck that has $x$ written on it. Now two players draw disjoint sets $A$ and $B$ of 100 cards each from this deck. We would like to define a rule that declares one of them a winner. This rule should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.\n2. If we write the elements of both sets in increasing order as $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{100}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{100}\\right\\}$, and $a_{i}>b_{i}$ for all $i$, then $A$ beats $B$.\n3. If three players draw three disjoint sets $A, B, C$ from the deck, $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $A$ also beats $C$.\n\nHow many ways are there to define such a rule? Here, we consider two rules as different if there exist two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ beats $B$ according to one rule, but $B$ beats $A$ according to the other. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts:**\n\n*   **Transitivity:** The third condition establishes a transitive relationship between the sets. This is crucial for defining a consistent rule.\n*   **Relative Order:** The first condition emphasizes that the rule must be based solely on the relative order of the cards, not their actual values.\n*   **Winning Condition:** The second condition defines a specific winning scenario (A beats B if all elements of A are greater than the corresponding elements of B).\n\n**2. Reformulate the Problem:**\n\n*   **Permutations and Rankings:** Consider the 200 cards as a permutation of the real numbers. The relative order of the cards defines a ranking.\n*   **Partitioning the Ranking:** The sets A and B partition the 200 cards. The rule must determine a winner based on the relative positions of the cards in the ranking.\n*   **Transitive Rule:** The rule must be transitive. If A beats B and B beats C, then A must beat C.\n\n**3. Key Insight:**\n\n*   **Majority Rule:** The problem is analogous to a voting system. The rule must be a way to determine a winner based on the relative positions of the cards.\n*   **Transitive Tournament:** The problem is equivalent to defining a transitive tournament on the 200 cards. A transitive tournament is a complete oriented graph where the edges represent the \"beats\" relationship, and the graph is transitive.\n*   **Rankings and Transitivity:** A transitive tournament can be represented by a ranking of the 200 cards. The rule must be based on this ranking.\n\n**4. Determine the Number of Rules:**\n\n*   **Rankings:** The number of possible rankings of the 200 cards is 200! (200 factorial).\n*   **Transitive Rules:** However, not all rankings will satisfy the transitivity condition. We need to find the number of rankings that are transitive.\n*   **Transitive Rankings:** A ranking is transitive if it can be represented as a sequence of elements where each element is greater than the previous one. This is equivalent to a permutation of the 200 cards.\n*   **Counting Transitive Rankings:** The number of transitive rankings is equal to the number of permutations of the 200 cards. This is 200!.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The number of ways to define such a rule is equal to the number of transitive rankings of the 200 cards, which is 200!.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Therefore, 1, the only odd number less than 2, cannot be expressed.\n*   **Proof of 1 being the largest:** Since all elements of $A_n$ are even, any sum of elements from $A_n$ will be even. Therefore, 1 is the only odd number that cannot be expressed. Since 1 is the smallest positive odd integer, it is the largest integer that cannot be expressed.\n\n**6.

        "question": "<input> Lucy starts by writing $s$ integer-valued 2022-tuples on a blackboard. After doing that, she can take any two (not necessarily distinct) tuples $\\mathbf{v}=\\left(v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{2022}\\right)$ and $\\mathbf{w}=\\left(w_{1}, \\ldots, w_{2022}\\right)$ that she has already written, and apply one of the following operations to obtain a new tuple:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{v}+\\mathbf{w}=\\left(v_{1}+w_{1}, \\ldots, v_{2022}+w_{2022}\\right) \\\\\n& \\mathbf{v} \\vee \\mathbf{w}=\\left(\\max \\left(v_{1}, w_{1}\\right), \\ldots, \\max \\left(v_{2022}, w_{2022}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand then write this tuple on the blackboard.\n\nIt turns out that, in this way, Lucy can write any integer-valued 2022-tuple on the blackboard after finitely many steps. What is the smallest possible number $s$ of tuples that she initially wrote? </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Operations and Their Properties:**\n\n*   **Addition:** The operation `v + w` is associative and commutative. It allows us to create new tuples by combining existing ones.\n*   **Max Operation:** The operation `v \u2228 w` is also associative and commutative. It allows us to create new tuples by taking the maximum of corresponding components.\n\n**2. Consider the Closure Property:**\n\n*   The problem states that Lucy can eventually write *any* integer-valued 2022-tuple. This means the set of tuples generated by the initial set and the operations is *closed* under the operations.\n\n**3. Think About the Role of the Initial Tuples:**\n\n*   The initial tuples are the \"building blocks\" from which all other tuples are generated.\n*   We need to find the *minimum* number of initial tuples required to generate all possible tuples.\n\n**4. Consider the Structure of the Problem:**\n\n*   The problem is similar to generating a vector space or a lattice. The operations resemble addition and the max operation.\n*   The key is to find a set of tuples that can generate all other tuples through the given operations.\n\n**5. Consider the Role of the Max Operation:**\n\n*   The max operation is crucial. It allows us to create tuples with large values in specific positions.\n*   If we have a tuple with a large value in a specific position, we can use the max operation to \"propagate\" that large value to other tuples.\n\n**6. Consider the Role of the Addition Operation:**\n\n*   The addition operation allows us to create tuples with values that are the sum of values from other tuples.\n*   This operation is essential for generating tuples with arbitrary integer values.\n\n**7. Consider the Role of the Zero Vector:**\n\n*   The zero vector (0, 0, ..., 0) is a special case. It can be used to generate other tuples through addition.\n*   If we have the zero vector, we can use it to create any tuple by adding it to another tuple.\n\n**8. Consider the Role of the Identity Element for the Max Operation:**\n\n*   The identity element for the max operation is negative infinity. However, we cannot have negative infinity as an integer.\n*   This means we cannot directly use the max operation to create tuples with negative values.\n\n**9. Consider the Role of the Initial Tuples:**\n\n*   We need to find a set of initial tuples that can generate all other tuples through the operations.\n*   The initial tuples should be chosen such that they can be combined to create all possible values in each position.\n\n**10. Consider the Role of the Number of Positions:**\n\n*   The problem involves 2022 positions. This suggests that the solution may involve a set of tuples that can generate all possible values in each position.\n\n**11. Consider the Role of the Integer Values:**\n\n*   The problem involves integer values. This means that the operations must be able to generate all possible integer values.\n\n**12. Consider the Role of the Operations Together:**\n\n*   The addition and max operations are not independent. They are related in a way that allows us to generate all possible integer values.\n\n**13. Consider the Role of the Problem's Goal:**\n\n*   The goal is to find the *minimum* number of initial tuples required to generate all possible integer-valued 2022-tuples.\n\n**14. Consider the Role of the Answer:**\n\n*   The answer is likely to be a small number, such as 2 or 3. This is because the operations are powerful and can generate a large number of tuples from a small set of initial tuples.\n\n**15. Consider the Role of the Solution Strategy:**\n\n*   The solution will likely involve a clever choice of initial tuples that can be combined to generate all other tuples.\n*   The solution will likely involve a proof that the chosen initial tuples are sufficient to generate all other tuples.\n*   The solution will likely involve a proof that the chosen initial tuples are necessary.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

        "question": "<input> Alice fills the fields of an $n \\times n$ board with numbers from 1 to $n^{2}$, each number being used exactly once. She then counts the total number of good paths on the board. A good path is a sequence of fields of arbitrary length (including 1) such that:\n\n(i) The first field in the sequence is one that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers,\n\n(ii) Each subsequent field in the sequence is adjacent to the previous field,\n\n(iii) The numbers written on the fields in the sequence are in increasing order.\n\nTwo fields are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Find the smallest possible number of good paths Alice can obtain, as a function of $n$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Good Paths:** We need to identify sequences of cells (paths) that satisfy three conditions:\n    *   The first cell has only neighbors with larger numbers.\n    *   Each subsequent cell is adjacent to the previous one.\n    *   The numbers on the path are in increasing order.\n*   **Goal:** Find the *minimum* number of such good paths that can exist on an n x n board filled with numbers 1 to n\u00b2.\n\n**2. Key Observations and Concepts:**\n\n*   **Adjacency:** Cells are adjacent if they share a side (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Number Placement:** The numbers 1 to n\u00b2 are used exactly once.\n*   **Good Path Characteristics:**\n    *   The first cell in a good path must be a \"local minimum\" (all its neighbors have larger numbers).\n    *   The path must be strictly increasing.\n    *   The path can be of any length (including 1).\n*   **Critical Insight:** The number of good paths is directly related to the arrangement of numbers on the board. We need to find an arrangement that minimizes the number of such paths.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Minimize Local Minima:** To minimize the number of good paths, we want to minimize the number of local minima (cells with only neighbors with larger numbers). This is because each local minimum can be the start of a good path.\n*   **Maximize Local Maxima:** Conversely, we want to maximize the number of local maxima (cells with only neighbors with smaller numbers). This is because local maxima cannot be the start of a good path.\n*   **Arrange Numbers Strategically:** We need to find a way to arrange the numbers 1 to n\u00b2 on the board to minimize the number of local minima. This might involve placing larger numbers in the center of the board and smaller numbers on the edges.\n*   **Consider Path Length:** While the problem allows for paths of any length, we should consider how the placement of numbers affects the potential for longer paths. We want to minimize the number of paths, not just the number of starting points.\n\n**4. Possible Approaches:**\n\n*   **Brute Force (for small n):** For small values of n (e.g., n=2, 3), we can try different number arrangements and count the number of good paths. This can help us identify patterns or conjectures.\n*   **Graph Theory:** Consider the board as a graph, where each cell is a node and edges connect adjacent cells. The problem becomes finding the number of increasing paths in this graph.\n*   **Combinatorics:** Analyze the number of possible paths and how the placement of numbers affects this count.\n*   **Mathematical Induction:** Try to find a pattern for small n and then prove it for all n.\n\n**5. Expected Answer:**\n\n*   The answer is likely to be a function of n, possibly involving n\u00b2 or n.\n*   The answer will be the *minimum* number of good paths, which is likely to be a small number compared to the total number of possible paths.\n*   The answer will be derived from a specific arrangement of numbers on the board that minimizes the number of good paths.\n\n**6. Implementation:**\n\n*   The plan will involve:\n    *   Analyzing the problem and identifying key concepts.\n    *   Considering different approaches and strategies.\n    *   Testing and refining the strategies.\n    *   Deriving a general formula or pattern.\n    *   Verifying the solution with examples and counterexamples.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

If we increase the first or second coordinate of a pair, the function value increases.\n*   This suggests that the function $f$ is a *monotonic* function.

This is a stronger condition than just being increasing.\n*   This means that the function $f$ can be thought of as a way to \"flatten\" the grid of integer pairs into a single sequence of non-negative integers, maintaining the order.\n\n**4.

Determine the smallest Norwegian number.\n\n(Note: The total number of positive divisors of a Norwegian number is allowed to be larger than 3.) </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem of finding the smallest Norwegian number:\n\n**1. Understand the Definition:**\n\n*   A Norwegian number has *three distinct positive divisors* whose sum is 2022.\n*   The number itself is not necessarily one of the three divisors.\n*   The total number of positive divisors can be more than 3.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Strategies:**\n\n*   **Divisors and Prime Factorization:**  The number of divisors of a number is determined by its prime factorization.  If a number N has a prime factorization of N = p^a * q^b * r^c..., then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)...  This will help us understand the possible structures of Norwegian numbers.\n*   **Divisor Pairs:**  For any number N, if d is a divisor, then N/d is also a divisor.  This can be useful in finding combinations of divisors that sum to 2022.\n*   **Prime Numbers:**  Prime numbers have only two divisors (1 and themselves).  Since we need three distinct divisors, the number itself cannot be prime.\n*   **Even and Odd Numbers:**  The sum of three numbers is even if either all three are even or one is even and two are odd.  This can help narrow down possibilities.\n*   **Brute Force with Optimization:**  We can start checking numbers from the smallest possible (starting with 2) and find the first one that meets the criteria.  However, we can optimize by considering the properties of divisors and the sum.\n\n**3. Plan of Action:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Consider the Sum of Divisors:**  Since the sum of the three divisors is 2022, we can consider the possible combinations of three numbers that add up to 2022.  We can start by considering the smallest possible divisors (1, 2, 3, etc.) and see if their sum can be 2022.\n*   **Step 2: Check for Divisors:**  For each number we consider, we need to find its divisors.  We can do this by checking divisibility.\n*   **Step 3: Check for Three Distinct Divisors:**  For each number, we need to find three distinct divisors that add up to 2022.\n*   **Step 4: Find the Smallest Number:**  We continue this process until we find the smallest number that meets the criteria.\n\n**4. Optimization Strategies:**\n\n*   **Start with Even Numbers:**  Since the sum of the three divisors is even, we can start checking even numbers first.\n*   **Consider the Divisors:**  We can consider the divisors of the number we are checking.  If we find two divisors that add up to a number close to 2022, we can check if the third divisor (2022 - sum of the two divisors) is also a divisor.\n*   **Use Prime Factorization:**  We can use the prime factorization of the number to find its divisors more efficiently.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The smallest Norwegian number will be the first number we find that meets the criteria.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given a divisibility condition involving factorials and products of sums of prime pairs.\n*   We need to find all positive integers $n > 2$ that satisfy this condition.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Theorems:**\n\n*   **Prime Numbers:** Understand the properties of prime numbers and their distribution.\n*   **Factorials:** Recall the definition and properties of factorials.\n*   **Divisibility:** Understand the concept of divisibility and how to determine if one number divides another.\n*   **Prime Factorization:** Know how to factorize numbers into their prime factors.\n*   **Wilson's Theorem:**  $ (p-1)! \\equiv -1 \\mod p $ for a prime $p$. This might be useful for analyzing the divisibility of factorials.\n*   **Chinese Remainder Theorem:**  This might be useful for analyzing divisibility by multiple primes.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Start with Small Values of n:**  Calculate the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) for small values of $n$ (e.g., $n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$) to identify a pattern or possible solutions.\n*   **Analyze the Prime Factorization of the RHS:**  Factorize the product $\\prod_{\\substack{p<q \\leqslant n \\\\ p, q \\text { primes }}}(p+q)$ into its prime factors. This will help us understand the divisibility condition.\n*   **Compare with the Prime Factorization of the LHS:**  Factorize $n!$ into its prime factors. Compare the prime factorizations of the LHS and RHS.\n*   **Use Wilson's Theorem:**  If applicable, use Wilson's Theorem to analyze the divisibility of the factorial.\n*   **Consider the Prime Factors of the RHS:**  Determine the prime factors of the RHS and see if they are all present in the LHS.\n*   **Look for Patterns or Constraints:**  Identify any patterns or constraints that emerge from the analysis. For example, if the RHS has a prime factor that is not present in the LHS, then $n$ cannot be a solution.\n*   **Generalize the Pattern:**  If a pattern is identified, try to generalize it to find a formula or condition for $n$.\n*   **Prove the Result:**  Once a pattern or condition is identified, prove that it holds for all $n > 2$.\n\n**4.

        "question": "<input> Find all triples of positive integers $(a, b, p)$ with $p$ prime and\n\n$$\na^{p}=b !+p\n$$ </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are looking for positive integers $a$, $b$, and a prime number $p$ that satisfy the equation $a^p = b! + p$.\n*   The key constraints are:\n    *   $a$, $b$, and $p$ are positive integers.\n    *   $p$ is a prime number.\n    *   $b!$ is the factorial of $b$.\n\n**2. Consider Small Values of p:**\n\n*   Since $p$ is a prime, we can start by testing small prime numbers: $p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \\ldots$.\n*   For each value of $p$, we can try to find values of $b$ and $a$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Equation:**\n\n*   Rearrange the equation: $a^p - p = b!$.\n*   This means $a^p - p$ must be a factorial.\n*   Factorials grow very quickly, so we can expect $b$ to be relatively small.\n\n**4. Consider the Parity of the Equation:**\n\n*   If $p = 2$, then the equation becomes $a^2 = b! + 2$.\n*   If $p$ is an odd prime, then $a^p$ is odd if $a$ is odd, and even if $a$ is even.\n*   $b!$ is even for $b \\geq 2$.\n*   Therefore, $a^p$ must be even if $p$ is an odd prime. This implies $a$ must be even.\n\n**5. Try Small Values of b:**\n\n*   Since $b!$ grows quickly, we can try small values of $b$ (e.g., $b = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$) and see if we can find corresponding values of $a$ and $p$ that satisfy the equation.\n\n**6. Consider the Growth of Factorials and Powers:**\n\n*   Factorials grow faster than powers. This means that for larger values of $b$, $b!$ will quickly outpace $a^p$.\n*   This suggests that we can limit the range of $b$ we need to check.\n\n**7. Use Modular Arithmetic:**\n\n*   Consider the equation modulo $p$.\n*   $a^p \\equiv b! + p \\pmod{p}$\n*   Since $p$ divides $p$, we have $a^p \\equiv b! \\pmod{p}$.\n*   This can help us eliminate some possibilities.\n\n**8. Systematic Search:**\n\n*   Create a table or list of possible values for $p$, $b$, and $a$.\n*   For each value of $p$, try small values of $b$ and calculate $b! + p$.\n*   Check if the result is a perfect $p$th power. If it is, then $a$ is the $p$th root of the result.\n\n**9. Verify and Eliminate:**\n\n*   For each candidate solution $(a, b, p)$, verify that it satisfies the original equation.\n*   Eliminate any solutions that do not satisfy the constraints.\n\n**10.

In every turn, Horst places a black knight on an empty square in such a way that his new knight does not attack any previous knights. Then Queenie places a white queen on an empty square. The game gets finished when somebody cannot move.\n\nFind the maximal positive $K$ such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least $K$ knights on the board. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Game Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Knight Movement:** A knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular. It can jump over other pieces.\n*   **Queen Movement:** A queen can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.\n*   **Game Objective:** The game ends when a player cannot move. The goal is to find the maximum number of knights (K) that Horst can guarantee placing on the board, regardless of Queenie's strategy.\n\n**2. Analyze the Knight's Placement Constraints:**\n\n*   **Non-Attacking Requirement:** Horst's knights must not attack each other. This means that no two knights can be placed in positions that are a knight's move apart.\n*   **Queenie's Interference:** Queenie places a queen after each of Horst's moves. The queen can potentially block the placement of future knights by attacking them.\n\n**3. Consider the Board and Knight Placement:**\n\n*   **Chessboard Layout:** A 20x20 board has 400 squares.\n*   **Knight Placement Strategy:** Horst needs to place knights in a way that maximizes the number of knights while avoiding attacks. This is similar to the classic \"knight's tour\" problem, but with the added complexity of Queenie's interference.\n*   **Blocking Strategy:** Queenie's queen can block potential knight placements. Horst needs to consider how to place knights in a way that minimizes the impact of Queenie's queen.\n\n**4. Consider the Game's End Condition:**\n\n*   **When the Game Ends:** The game ends when Horst cannot place a knight without it being attacked by a previous knight or by Queenie's queen.\n*   **Queenie's Moves:** Queenie can place her queen in a way that blocks the most potential knight placements. Horst needs to consider how to counter this.\n\n**5. Develop a Strategy for Horst:**\n\n*   **Optimal Knight Placement:** Horst needs to find a way to place knights in a pattern that maximizes the number of knights while minimizing the number of squares that can be attacked by the knights.\n*   **Counteracting Queenie's Queen:** Horst needs to consider how to place knights in a way that minimizes the number of squares that can be attacked by Queenie's queen.\n\n**6. Consider the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n\n*   **Queenie's Optimal Strategy:** Queenie will try to place her queen in a way that blocks the most potential knight placements.\n*   **Horst's Guarantee:** We need to find the maximum number of knights (K) that Horst can guarantee placing on the board, regardless of how Queenie places her queen.\n\n**7. Consider the Maximum Number of Knights:**\n\n*   **Maximum Non-Attacking Knights:** On a 20x20 board, the maximum number of non-attacking knights is 200. This is because knights can be placed on all squares of one color (e.g., all the white squares).\n*   **Impact of Queenie's Queen:** Queenie's queen can potentially block some of these placements.\n\n**8. Consider the Game's Flow:**\n\n*   **Turn Order:** Horst places a knight, then Queenie places a queen.\n*   **Queenie's Advantage:** Queenie has the advantage of placing her queen after each of Horst's moves, which can potentially block future knight placements.\n\n**9. Consider the Final Answer:**\n\n*   **The Answer:** The final answer will be the maximum number of knights (K) that Horst can guarantee placing on the board, regardless of Queenie's strategy.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Strategy:**\n\n*   **Graph Theory Representation:** Represent the players as vertices in a complete graph.

Each color represents a day.\n*   **Optimal Edge Coloring:** The minimum number of colors needed to edge-color a complete graph with an even number of vertices (2k) is 2k-1. This is a known result in graph theory.\n*   **Implication:** We need to schedule the matches over 2k-1 days.\n*   **Player Stay Duration:** Each player will play (2k-2) matches (since they play against all other players). Therefore, each player will stay for (2k-2) days.\n*   **Total Cost:** The total cost is the number of players multiplied by the number of days each player stays.\n\n**4.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given a set of real numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_d$ with a total sum of $n$.\n*   Each number is between 0 and 1.\n*   We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that we can always partition these numbers into $k$ groups, where the sum of the numbers in each group is at most 1.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Theorems:**\n\n*   **Greedy Algorithm:** A simple approach to partitioning. Sort the numbers in descending order and place each number into the first group that has a sum less than 1.\n*   **Pigeonhole Principle:** If we have more items than containers, at least one container must contain more than one item.\n*   **Bin Packing Problem:** This is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to pack items of different sizes into bins of fixed capacity. The problem is NP-hard, but we are looking for a guaranteed solution, not an optimal one.\n*   **Worst-case Scenario:** We need to consider the worst-case arrangement of the numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_d$.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Consider the Worst-case Scenario:** What is the worst-case arrangement of the numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_d$ that would require the most groups? This is likely when the numbers are as large as possible (close to 1) and as many as possible.\n*   **Analyze the Greedy Algorithm:** How many groups would the greedy algorithm require in the worst-case scenario?\n*   **Relate to the Bin Packing Problem:** The problem is similar to the bin packing problem, where the \"bins\" are the groups and the \"items\" are the numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_d$.\n*   **Find a Lower Bound for k:** What is the minimum number of groups that could be required in the worst-case scenario? This is the lower bound for $k$.\n*   **Find an Upper Bound for k:** What is the maximum number of groups that could be required in the worst-case scenario? This is the upper bound for $k$.\n*   **Determine the Value of k:** If the lower bound and upper bound for $k$ are the same, then we have found the value of $k$.\n\n**4. Execution:**\n\n*   **Worst-case Scenario:** Consider the case where we have $n$ numbers each equal to 1. This would require $n$ groups.\n*   **Greedy Algorithm:** If we use the greedy algorithm, we would place each number into a separate group. This would also require $n$ groups.\n*   **Bin Packing Problem:** The bin packing problem is NP-hard, but we are looking for a guaranteed solution. The greedy algorithm is a simple approach that guarantees a solution.\n*   **Lower Bound for k:** The lower bound for $k$ is $n$.\n*   **Upper Bound for k:** The upper bound for $k$ is $n$.\n*   **Value of k:** Since the lower bound and upper bound for $k$ are the same, the value of $k$ is $n$.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\n*   The smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the given condition is $n$.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points.\n*   No three points are collinear.\n*   We need to draw `k` lines that divide the plane into regions.\n*   The goal is to ensure that no region contains both red and blue points.\n*   We need to find the minimal `k` that works for *any* configuration of the points.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Theorems:**\n\n*   **Separating Lines:** A line that separates two sets of points.\n*   **Arrangement of Lines:** The way lines divide the plane into regions.\n*   **Convex Hull:** The smallest convex polygon that contains all the points.\n*   **Duality (Optional):** A technique that can be used to transform the problem into a different form.\n*   **Induction (Optional):** A proof technique that might be useful for generalizing the solution.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Consider the Convex Hull:** The convex hull of all the points will contain all the points. We need to find a way to separate the red and blue points using lines.\n*   **Separate the Points:** We need to find a way to draw lines that separate the red and blue points. This might involve drawing lines that pass between the red and blue points.\n*   **Use the Pigeonhole Principle:** If we draw too few lines, it's possible that some region will contain both red and blue points.\n*   **Consider the Worst-Case Scenario:** We need to find a value of `k` that works for *any* configuration of the points. This means we need to consider the most challenging configuration.\n*   **Try Small Cases:** Consider smaller numbers of red and blue points (e.g., 1 red and 1 blue, 2 red and 2 blue) to see if we can find a pattern.\n*   **Generalize:** Try to find a general formula or pattern that relates the number of red and blue points to the number of lines needed.\n\n**4. Potential Approach:**\n\n*   **Separate the Points:** We need to draw lines that separate the red and blue points. This might involve drawing lines that pass between the red and blue points.\n*   **Use the Convex Hull:** The convex hull of the red points and the convex hull of the blue points might be useful in determining the number of lines needed.\n*   **Consider the Number of Lines Needed to Separate the Points:** We need to find the minimal number of lines that can separate the red and blue points.\n*   **Use the Pigeonhole Principle:** If we draw `k` lines, the number of regions created will be `k(k+1)/2 + 1`. We need to ensure that the number of regions is sufficient to separate the red and blue points.\n*   **Find a Lower Bound:** We need to find a lower bound for `k`. This means we need to find the smallest number of lines that is guaranteed to work for any configuration.\n*   **Find an Upper Bound:** We need to find an upper bound for `k`. This means we need to find a number of lines that is guaranteed to work for any configuration.\n*   **Prove the Result:** We need to prove that the value of `k` we find is the minimal value that works for any configuration.\n\n**5. Expected Outcome:**\n\n*   The minimal value of `k` will be a function of the number of red and blue points.\n*   The answer will likely be a simple expression involving the number of red and blue points.\n*   The answer will be a small integer.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Understand the Problem Statement:**\n\n*   We are looking for functions $f: \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}^+$ (positive integers to positive integers).\n*   The key condition is that for any positive integers $x$ and $y$, the lengths $x$, $f(y)$, and $f(y + f(x) - 1)$ must form a non-degenerate triangle.\n\n**2.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Key Concepts:** We are dealing with triples of nonnegative integers that sum to a given integer `n`. The challenge is to maximize the number of such triples while ensuring that no two triples share the same value in any of the three positions (a, b, or c).\n\n*   **Constraints:** The main constraints are:\n    *   Each triple must sum to `n`.\n    *   No two triples can have the same value in any of the three positions.\n\n**2. Simplify the Problem:**\n\n*   **Focus on One Position:** Consider the constraints on one position, say `a`. For each possible value of `a`, we can determine the possible values of `b` and `c` that satisfy the sum constraint. This will help us understand the limitations on the number of triples.\n\n*   **Consider the Range of Values:** Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are nonnegative integers, their possible values are limited. For example, if `a` is 0, then `b + c = n`. If `a` is 1, then `b + c = n - 1`, and so on.\n\n**3. Analyze the Constraints:**\n\n*   **Unique Values:** The constraint that no two triples can share the same value in any position means that for each position (a, b, or c), we can only use each value once. This is a crucial point.\n\n*   **Implications for the Number of Triples:** The number of possible values for each position is limited. For example, if `a` can take values from 0 to n, then there are `n+1` possible values for `a`. However, we can only use each value once. This suggests that the number of triples is limited by the number of possible values for each position.\n\n**4. Consider the Maximum Number of Triples:**\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** The maximum number of triples is limited by the number of possible values for each position. Since we can only use each value once, the maximum number of triples is equal to the number of possible values for one of the positions.\n\n*   **Optimal Strategy:** To maximize the number of triples, we need to find a way to assign values to `a`, `b`, and `c` such that we can use as many different values as possible in each position.\n\n**5. Consider Specific Cases:**\n\n*   **Small Values of n:** Start by analyzing small values of `n` (e.g., n=2, n=3, n=4) to see if we can find a pattern or a general formula.\n\n*   **Look for Patterns:** Try to find a pattern in the number of triples for different values of `n`. This might help us identify a general formula.\n\n**6. Generalize the Solution:**\n\n*   **Formulate a General Formula:** Based on the analysis of small cases and the constraints, try to formulate a general formula for `N(n)`.\n\n*   **Justify the Formula:** Provide a justification for the formula you derive. This might involve a proof by induction or a combinatorial argument.\n\n**7.

A nonintersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise different squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non-intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the first square of the route and start over.\n\nHow many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit? </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem of finding the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook on a 999x999 board:\n\n**1.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given a set of integers from 1 to n.\n*   We need to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs (pairs that don't share any elements).\n*   The sum of each pair must be a unique integer.\n*   The sum of each pair must be less than or equal to n.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Observations:**\n\n*   **Disjoint Pairs:** Pairs that don't share any elements.\n*   **Unique Sums:** Each pair's sum must be different.\n*   **Sum Constraints:** The sum of each pair must be <= n.\n*   **Pairing Strategy:** We need to find a way to pair numbers to maximize the number of pairs while satisfying the constraints.\n*   **Sum Range:** The possible sums of pairs range from 1+2=3 to n-1+n=2n-1. However, we are only interested in sums <= n.\n*   **Maximum Possible Sums:** The largest possible sum we can have is n.

Strategy Development:**\n\n*   **Start with the largest possible sum:** The largest possible sum is n. We can only get this sum by pairing n-1 and 1.\n*   **Work backwards:** Try to find pairs that give the next largest possible sum (n-1), then n-2, and so on.\n*   **Avoid Overlapping Elements:** Ensure that the elements used in one pair are not used in another pair.\n*   **Track Used Elements:** Keep track of which elements have been used in pairs to avoid repetition.\n*   **Maximize the Number of Pairs:** Continue this process until we can't form any more pairs that satisfy the constraints.\n\n**4.

Understand the Game Mechanics:**\n\n*   **Initial Setup:**  N coins and 2012 boxes arranged in a circle. A distributes the coins so that each box has at least 1 coin.\n*   **Player B's Move:**  B moves 1 coin from each box to an adjacent box. This results in a redistribution of coins.\n*   **Player A's Move:**  A can choose several coins (not involved in B's move) from different boxes and move them to adjacent boxes. A's goal is to maintain at least 1 coin in each box after her move.\n\n**2. Analyze the Impact of B's Move:**\n\n*   **Coin Redistribution:**  B's move redistributes coins by moving 1 coin from each box to an adjacent box. This can potentially create boxes with 0 coins.\n*   **Key Insight:**  B's move is deterministic and predictable.  We need to find a strategy for A to counteract this.\n\n**3. Consider the Nature of A's Move:**\n\n*   **Flexibility:**  A has the flexibility to choose which coins to move and to which boxes.\n*   **Goal:**  A's goal is to ensure that after her move, every box has at least 1 coin.\n\n**4.

This can be done using a recursive algorithm or by listing all combinations.\n*   **Step 3: Calculate Rectangle Areas:** For each set of five pairs, calculate the area of each rectangle.\n*   **Step 4: Check for Square Area:** For each set of five pairs, check if the sum of the areas of the rectangles equals `m^2` (from Step 1). If not, discard this set.\n*   **Step 5: Check for Rectangle Dimensions:** For each valid set of five pairs, check if the rectangles can be arranged to form a square. This involves checking if the sum of the widths of the rectangles in each row equals `m` and the sum of the heights of the rectangles in each column equals `m`.\n*   **Step 6: Determine Valid `m` Values:** For each valid arrangement, record the value of `m`. If multiple values of `m` are found, list them all.\n\n**4. Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Efficiency:** The number of possible pairings is large, so an efficient algorithm or a computer program may be necessary to generate and check all possibilities.\n*   **Symmetry:** Consider the possibility of symmetrical arrangements of the rectangles.\n*   **Edge Cases:** Consider the possibility of very small or very large values of `m`.\n\n**5. Tools and Techniques:**\n\n*   **Mathematical Calculations:** Basic arithmetic and algebra.\n*   **Combinatorics:** Generating combinations and permutations.\n*   **Programming (Optional):** A computer program can be used to generate and check all possible pairings and arrangements.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

        "question": "<input> Let $k$ be a positive integer. Lexi has a dictionary $\\mathcal{D}$ consisting of some $k$-letter strings containing only the letters $A$ and $B$. Lexi would like to write either the letter $A$ or the letter $B$ in each cell of a $k \\times k$ grid so that each column contains a string from $\\mathcal{D}$ when read from top-to-bottom and each row contains a string from $\\mathcal{D}$ when read from left-to-right.\n\nWhat is the smallest integer $m$ such that if $\\mathcal{D}$ contains at least $m$ different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in this manner, no matter what strings are in $\\mathcal{D}$ ? </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the smallest number `m` such that, regardless of the contents of the dictionary `D` (as long as it has at least `m` strings), we can always fill a `k x k` grid.\n*   The grid must satisfy two conditions:\n    *   Each column, when read top to bottom, must be a string in `D`.\n    *   Each row, when read left to right, must be a string in `D`.\n\n**2. Consider Small Cases:**\n\n*   **Case k=1:** The grid is 1x1. We need a single string in `D`. So, `m=1`.\n*   **Case k=2:** The grid is 2x2. We need to find the smallest `m` such that, no matter what 2-letter strings are in `D`, we can always fill the grid. Consider different possibilities for `D` and try to find a pattern.\n\n**3. Generalize the Problem:**\n\n*   Think about the grid as a combination of rows and columns.\n*   Each row must be a string in `D`, and each column must be a string in `D`.\n*   The grid must be filled with `k` rows and `k` columns, each of length `k`.\n\n**4.

The sequence must satisfy the following conditions:\n\n1. **Skolem Sequence Conditions:**\n   - For every $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$, there are exactly two elements $s_i$ and $s_j$ such that $s_i = s_j = k$.\n   - If $s_i = s_j = k$ with $i < j$, then $j - i = k$.\n\n2. **Additional Conditions:**\n   - $s_3 = 1$\n   - $s_{18} = 8$\n   - Between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the Skolem Sequence Conditions\n\nLet's consider the implications of the Skolem sequence conditions.\n\n### Condition (i): Each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly twice.\n\nThis means the sequence contains the numbers 1 through 9, each appearing exactly twice.\n\n### Condition (ii): If $s_i = s_j = k$ with $i < j$, then $j - i = k$.\n\nThis means that for each number $k$, the two positions where $k$ appears must be $k$ apart. For example, if $k = 1$, then the two positions where 1 appears must be $i$ and $i+1$.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Apply the Additional Conditions\n\n### Condition I: $s_3 = 1$\n\nThis means the first occurrence of 1 is at position 3. Since $s_3 = 1$, the second occurrence of 1 must be at position $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nSo, we have:\n$$\ns_3 = 1, \\quad s_4 = 1\n$$\n\n### Condition II: $s_{18} = 8$\n\nThis means the first occurrence of 8 is at position 18. The second occurrence of 8 must be at position $18 + 8 = 26$, but this is outside the range of the sequence (which has only 18 elements). Therefore, the second occurrence of 8 must be at position $18 - 8 = 10$.\n\nSo, we have:\n$$\ns_{10} = 8, \\quad s_{18} = 8\n$$\n\n### Condition III: Between any two equal even integers, there is exactly one odd integer.\n\nThis means that for any even number $k$, the two positions where $k$ appears must be separated by exactly one odd number.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the implications of this condition for the even numbers.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Consider the Even Numbers\n\nWe know the positions of 8: $s_{10} = 8$ and $s_{18} = 8$. The positions are 10 and 18, which are 8 apart. The number of elements between them is $18 - 10 - 1 = 7$, which is odd. So, the condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, we need to consider the other even numbers: 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the possible positions for the other even numbers.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Consider the Odd Numbers\n\nWe know that the sequence contains the numbers 1 through 9, each appearing exactly twice. So, the sequence has 18 elements, and the numbers 1 through 9 are distributed in the sequence.\n\nWe already have:\n- $s_3 = 1$\n- $s_4 = 1$\n- $s_{10} = 8$\n- $s_{18} = 8$\n\nSo, we have used up the numbers 1 and 8.\n\nWe need to place the remaining numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the implications of the odd/even condition.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Consider the Even Numbers\n\nLet\u2019s consider the even numbers: 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nWe already have 8 placed at positions 10 and 18.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the possible positions for the other even numbers.\n\n### Consider 2\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the two positions where 2 appears are $i$ and $i+2$.

The time it takes for sound to travel a distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed.\n*   **Time Differences:** The problem provides time differences between the microphones receiving the sound. These differences will be crucial in determining distances.\n*   **Coordinate System:** We can use a coordinate system to represent the positions of the microphones and the explosion. Let's place microphone B at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.\n*   **Distance Formula:** The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula:  sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2).\n\n**2.

Solve for 'd':**\n\n*   The time difference between B and A is given as 1/2 seconds. However, our calculation shows it's 3 seconds. This discrepancy indicates a need to re-examine the problem.\n*   The time difference between A and C is given as 1 second. However, our calculation shows it's 3 seconds. This discrepancy indicates a need to re-examine the problem.\n*   The problem states that the time difference between B and A is 1/2 seconds. This means that the time it takes for sound to travel from P to A is 1/2 seconds more than the time it takes to travel from P to B.\n*   The problem states that the time difference between A and C is 1 second. This means that the time it takes for sound to travel from P to C is 1 second more than the time it takes to travel from P to A.\n*   We can use these time differences to set up equations involving the distances from P to A, B, and C.\n*   We can then solve these equations to find the value of 'd', which represents the distance from P to B.\n\n**4.

Understanding the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the number of positive integers with exactly `n` digits and a digit sum of 5.\n*   We are given a function `f(n)` that represents this count.\n*   We need to determine how many of the values `f(1), f(2), ..., f(2014)` have a units digit of 1.\n\n**2. Reformulating the Problem:**\n\n*   The problem can be rephrased as: How many non-negative integer solutions are there to the equation `d1 + d2 + ... + dn = 5` where `d1 >= 1` (since the number must have `n` digits, the first digit cannot be zero) and `0 <= di <= 9` for `i = 2, 3, ..., n`?\n\n**3. Combinatorics Approach:**\n\n*   This is a classic stars and bars problem with constraints.\n*   We can use the stars and bars theorem to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation `d1 + d2 + ... + dn = 5` without constraints.\n*   We will then subtract the number of solutions where one or more digits exceed 9 (since digits can only be 0-9).\n\n**4. Calculating f(n):**\n\n*   **Step 1: Unconstrained Solutions:** Calculate the number of non-negative integer solutions to `d1 + d2 + ... + dn = 5` using the stars and bars theorem. This is given by the combination formula: C(5 + n - 1, n - 1) = C(n + 4, n - 1).\n*   **Step 2: Subtract Invalid Solutions:** Subtract the number of solutions where one or more digits exceed 9. This requires considering cases where one digit is 10 or more, and so on. This can be done using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n**5.

Explore Recursive Relationships:**\n\n*   Let's consider the relationship between consecutive terms in the sum.\n*   For example, consider the terms 1/sin(8\u00b0) and 1/sin(16\u00b0). 16\u00b0 = 2 * 8\u00b0, so we can use the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2 sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n*   This leads to: 1/sin(16\u00b0) = 1/(2 sin(8\u00b0) cos(8\u00b0)) = (1/(2 sin(8\u00b0))) * (1/cos(8\u00b0))\n*   This suggests a pattern where each term can be expressed in terms of the previous term.\n\n**5.

This means `a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, and `b + c > a`.\n*   **Perimeter:** The sum of the side lengths, `a + b + c = n`.\n*   **Integer Side Lengths:** `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers.\n*   **Positive Area:** The triangle must be non-degenerate, which is ensured by the triangle inequality theorem.\n*   **Symmetry:** The number of triangles with side lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` is the same as the number of triangles with side lengths `a`, `c`, and `b`, etc. We can use this to avoid counting duplicates.\n*   **Reduction to a Single Variable:** We can express `T(n)` in terms of a single variable by fixing one side length and using the triangle inequality theorem to find the possible values of the other two side lengths.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Express T(n) in terms of a single variable.**\n    *   Let `a` be the smallest side length. Then `b` and `c` must satisfy `a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, and `b + c > a`.\n    *   Since `a + b + c = n`, we can express `c` as `n - a - b`.\n    *   Substitute `c = n - a - b` into the triangle inequality theorem to find the possible values of `a` and `b`.\n    *   This will give us a range of values for `a` and `b` that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.\n*   **Step 2: Count the number of valid triangles.**\n    *   For each valid value of `a`, determine the range of valid values for `b`.\n    *   For each valid value of `a` and `b`, determine the corresponding value of `c`.\n    *   Count the number of valid combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n*   **Step 3: Find the smallest n such that T(n) > 2010.**\n    *   Start with small values of `n` and calculate `T(n)` using the above steps.\n    *   Continue increasing `n` until `T(n) > 2010`.\n    *   The smallest such `n` is the answer.\n\n**4. Optimization (Optional):**\n\n*   We can optimize the calculation of `T(n)` by using the formula for the number of integer-sided triangles with a given perimeter. This formula is derived from the triangle inequality theorem and the symmetry of the problem.\n*   The formula is: `T(n) = floor((n-1)(n-2)/2) - floor((n-1)/2) * floor((n-2)/2)`. This formula can be used to calculate `T(n)` directly without having to iterate through all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\n**5. Implementation:**\n\n*   The plan can be implemented using a programming language or a spreadsheet.\n*   The key steps are:\n    *   Iterate through values of `n` starting from 3.\n    *   For each `n`, calculate `T(n)` using the formula or the step-by-step method.\n    *   Stop when `T(n) > 2010`.\n    *   Return the value of `n`.\n\n**6. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The smallest positive integer `n` such that `T(n) > 2010` will be the answer.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Define Variables:**\n\n*   Let 'v' be the speed of the trains in km/h.\n*   Let 'd' be the distance between the station and the first train that passes Linh.\n*   Let 't' be the time it takes for a train to catch up to Linh.\n\n**4. Create Equations:**\n\n*   **Relative Speed:** The relative speed of the train to Linh is (v - 60) km/h.\n*   **Distance Covered by Train:** The train covers the distance 'd' in time 't' at a relative speed of (v - 60) km/h.  So, d = (v - 60) * t.\n*   **Distance Covered by Linh:** In the same time 't', Linh covers a distance of 60 * t km.\n*   **Distance Between Trains:** The distance between the station and the first train is the same as the distance between the first and second train, which is the distance Linh covers in 3 minutes (0.05 hours).  So, d = 60 * 0.05 = 3 km.\n*   **Time Between Train Passes:** The time between the first and second train passing Linh is 10 minutes (0.1667 hours).  This is the time it takes for the second train to catch up to Linh after the first one has passed her.  So, t = 0.1667 hours.\n\n**5. Solve the Equations:**\n\n*   Substitute the value of 'd' (3 km) and 't' (0.1667 hours) into the equation d = (v - 60) * t.\n*   Solve for 'v', the speed of the trains.\n\n**6.

Analyze the Equations:**\n\n*   **Equation 1:**  $\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} = 8$  - This is a radical equation involving square roots.  We can consider squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots.\n*   **Equation 2:**  $\\log_{10} a + \\log_{10} b = 2$  - This is a logarithmic equation.  We can use the logarithmic identity $\\log_b x + \\log_b y = \\log_b (xy)$ to simplify the left-hand side.\n\n**2. Simplify the Logarithmic Equation:**\n\n*   Apply the logarithmic identity to Equation 2:  $\\log_{10} (ab) = 2$\n*   Convert the logarithmic equation to its exponential form:  $ab = 10^2 = 100$\n\n**3. Manipulate the Radical Equation:**\n\n*   Let $x = \\sqrt{a}$ and $y = \\sqrt{b}$.  Then, Equation 1 becomes:  $x + y = 8$\n*   Since $x = \\sqrt{a}$, then $a = x^2$.  Similarly, $b = y^2$.\n*   Substitute $a = x^2$ and $b = y^2$ into the simplified logarithmic equation:  $x^2 y^2 = 100$\n\n**4. Solve the System of Equations:**\n\n*   We now have a system of two equations:\n    *   $x + y = 8$\n    *   $x^2 y^2 = 100$\n*   Solve the first equation for one variable in terms of the other.  For example, solve for $y$:  $y = 8 - x$\n*   Substitute the expression for $y$ from the first equation into the second equation:  $x^2 (8 - x)^2 = 100$\n*   Expand and simplify the equation:  $x^2 (64 - 16x + x^2) = 100$\n*   Expand and simplify further:  $64x^2 - 16x^3 + x^4 = 100$\n*   Rearrange the equation:  $x^4 - 16x^3 + 64x^2 - 100 = 0$\n*   Solve the quartic equation for $x$.  This may involve factoring, using the Rational Root Theorem, or other methods.\n*   Once the values of $x$ are found, substitute them back into the equation $y = 8 - x$ to find the corresponding values of $y$.\n*   Finally, substitute the values of $x$ and $y$ back into the equations $a = x^2$ and $b = y^2$ to find the values of $a$ and $b$.\n\n**5. Verify the Solutions:**\n\n*   Substitute the found values of $a$ and $b$ back into the original system of equations to ensure they satisfy both equations.\n\n**6.

The expected value of $|a_i - a_j|$ is the average of $|x - y|$ for all $x, y \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 200\\}$ with $x \\ne y$.\n\nWe can calculate this expected value as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{Expected value} = \\frac{1}{200 \\cdot 199} \\sum_{x=1}^{200} \\sum_{y=1}^{200} |x - y| \\text{ for } x \\ne y\n$$\n\nWe can simplify this sum by considering the symmetry of the absolute value function.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find all even integers `n` less than 100 that are \"savage.\"\n*   A number is savage if we can partition the set {1, 2, ..., n} into three subsets A, B, and C with specific properties.\n\n**2. Analyze the Properties:**\n\n*   **Property i:** The sum of the elements in each subset (A, B, and C) must be equal. This means the total sum of {1, 2, ..., n} must be divisible by 3.\n*   **Property ii:** A contains only odd numbers. This means the sum of A must be the sum of some subset of the odd numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}.\n*   **Property iii:** B contains only even numbers. This means the sum of B must be the sum of some subset of the even numbers in {1, 2, ..., n}.\n*   **Property iv:** C contains every multiple of 3. This means the sum of C must be the sum of all multiples of 3 in {1, 2, ..., n} plus any other numbers that are not in A or B.\n\n**3. Develop a Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the Total Sum:** Calculate the total sum of {1, 2, ..., n} using the formula: `n(n+1)/2`. This sum must be divisible by 3 for the number to be savage.\n*   **Step 2: Identify Multiples of 3:** Find all multiples of 3 in {1, 2, ..., n}. The sum of these multiples will be part of the sum of C.\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Numbers:** The remaining numbers (not multiples of 3) must be partitioned into A and B. A must contain only odd numbers, and B must contain only even numbers.\n*   **Step 4: Check for Feasibility:** For each even `n` less than 100, check if the total sum is divisible by 3. If it is, then check if the remaining numbers (after removing the multiples of 3) can be partitioned into A and B such that the sum of A and B are equal to the sum of C.\n*   **Step 5: Consider the Parity of the Sum:** The sum of the remaining numbers (after removing the multiples of 3) must be even. This is because the sum of A (which contains only odd numbers) and the sum of B (which contains only even numbers) must be equal. The sum of A will be odd (since it contains only odd numbers), and the sum of B will be even (since it contains only even numbers). Therefore, the sum of the remaining numbers must be odd.\n*   **Step 6: Iterate and Test:** Iterate through all even integers `n` less than 100. For each `n`, perform the steps above. If all conditions are met, then `n` is a savage number.\n\n**4. Key Considerations:**\n\n*   The sum of the remaining numbers (after removing the multiples of 3) must be even.\n*   The sum of the remaining numbers must be divisible by 2.\n*   The sum of the remaining numbers must be equal to the sum of the multiples of 3.\n*   The sum of the remaining numbers must be divisible by 3.\n*   The sum of the remaining numbers must be divisible by 2 and 3.\n*   The sum of the remaining numbers must be divisible by 6.\n\n**5.

We need to find the values of $ x $, $ y $, and $ z $ for team E.\n\n## Key Observations\n\n1. **Total Games per Team:** Each team plays 20 games.\n2. **Game Outcomes:** For each team, the total number of games played is equal to the sum of wins, losses, and ties:\n   $$\n   W + L + T = 20\n   $$\n3. **Total Wins, Losses, and Ties in the League:** Since each game has a result (W, L, or T), the total number of wins, losses, and ties across all teams must be equal to the total number of games played in the league.\n\n## Step 1: Calculate Total Wins, Losses, and Ties for Teams A, B, C, and D\n\nLet's calculate the total number of wins, losses, and ties for teams A, B, C, and D.\n\n### Team A\n- Wins: 2\n- Losses: 15\n- Ties: 3\n- Total games: $ 2 + 15 + 3 = 20 $\n\n### Team B\n- Wins: 7\n- Losses: 9\n- Ties: 4\n- Total games: $ 7 + 9 + 4 = 20 $\n\n### Team C\n- Wins: 6\n- Losses: 12\n- Ties: 2\n- Total games: $ 6 + 12 + 2 = 20 $\n\n### Team D\n- Wins: 10\n- Losses: 8\n- Ties: 2\n- Total games: $ 10 + 8 + 2 = 20 $\n\n## Step 2: Calculate Total Wins, Losses, and Ties for the League\n\nLet's calculate the total number of wins, losses, and ties for the league.\n\n### Total Wins\n- Team A: 2\n- Team B: 7\n- Team C: 6\n- Team D: 10\n- Team E: $ x $\n- Total Wins: $ 2 + 7 + 6 + 10 + x = 25 + x $\n\n### Total Losses\n- Team A: 15\n- Team B: 9\n- Team C: 12\n- Team D: 8\n- Team E: $ y $\n- Total Losses: $ 15 + 9 + 12 + 8 + y = 44 + y $\n\n### Total Ties\n- Team A: 3\n- Team B: 4\n- Team C: 2\n- Team D: 2\n- Team E: $ z $\n- Total Ties: $ 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + z = 11 + z $\n\n## Step 3: Calculate Total Games in the League\n\nEach team plays 20 games, and there are 5 teams.

        "question": "<input> Three thin metal rods of lengths 9,12 and 15 are welded together to form a right-angled triangle, which is held in a horizontal position. A solid sphere of radius 5 rests in the triangle so that it is tangent to each of the three sides. Assuming that the thickness of the rods can be neglected, how high above the plane of the triangle is the top of the sphere? </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry:**\n\n*   The triangle formed by the rods is a right-angled triangle.  The sides are 9, 12, and 15 units long.  The longest side (15) is the hypotenuse.\n*   The sphere is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.  This means the center of the sphere lies at the incenter of the triangle.\n*   The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.  It is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.\n\n**2. Find the Inradius:**\n\n*   The radius of the sphere is the inradius of the triangle.  The inradius (r) of a right-angled triangle can be calculated using the formula: r = (a + b - c) / 2, where a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse.\n*   Alternatively, the inradius can be calculated using the formula: r = A / s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter.\n\n**3. Calculate the Area and Semi-perimeter:**\n\n*   Calculate the area (A) of the triangle using the formula: A = (1/2) * base * height.  Since it's a right-angled triangle, the legs can be used as the base and height.\n*   Calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle: s = (a + b + c) / 2.\n\n**4. Determine the Inradius:**\n\n*   Use the area and semi-perimeter to calculate the inradius (r) using the formula: r = A / s.\n\n**5. Find the Height of the Sphere:**\n\n*   The height of the sphere above the plane of the triangle is the distance from the incenter (center of the sphere) to the plane of the triangle.  This is equal to the inradius (r).\n\n**6.

What is the value of $n$ ? </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1.

This means the probabilities are not uniform; they depend on the value of `x`.\n*   The sum of all probabilities for `x` from 1 to 99 must equal 1. This is a crucial constraint.\n\n**2.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the probability that the difference between the sums of the remaining balls in Billy's and Crystal's bags is a multiple of 4.\n*   The key is to consider the possible values of the removed balls and how they affect the sums.\n\n**2.

Establish Key Relationships:**\n\n*   **Age Relationship:** Charlie's age in 2014 is the difference between 2014 and his birth year: `A = 2014 - B`.\n*   **Age and Year Relationship:** The problem states that Charlie's age is twice the rightmost two digits of his birth year: `A = 2 * Y`.\n*   **Year Relationship:** The rightmost two digits of the birth year are the last two digits of the year, so `Y = B % 100`.\n\n**3. Formulate Equations:**\n\n*   From the age relationship: `A = 2014 - B`\n*   From the age and year relationship: `A = 2 * Y`\n*   From the year relationship: `Y = B % 100`\n\n**4. Substitute and Simplify:**\n\n*   Substitute `A = 2014 - B` into `A = 2 * Y`: `2014 - B = 2 * Y`\n*   Substitute `Y = B % 100` into the above equation: `2014 - B = 2 * (B % 100)`\n\n**5. Solve for B:**\n\n*   The equation `2014 - B = 2 * (B % 100)` can be solved for `B`. This will involve testing values of `B` within the range of the twentieth century (1901-2000) and checking if the equation holds true.\n\n**6.

This method would involve checking if the first and last characters are the same, and then recursively checking the substring in between.\n*   **Pattern Recognition:**  If a pattern is identified in the positions of palindromes, we can use that to count the number of palindromes in the first 1000 terms without having to check each term individually.\n*   **Efficient Calculation:**  If a pattern is not easily identifiable, we can use the recursive definition to build the sequence and check each term for being a palindrome.

Understand the Definition of a Tenuous Function:**\n\n*   The function $f$ is tenuous if for *any* positive integers $x$ and $y$, the inequality $f(x) + f(y) > x^2$ holds.\n*   This means that for any pair of positive integers, the sum of the function values at those integers must be greater than the square of the first integer.\n\n**2.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the smallest positive integer `n` such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n^3` and `n!` is at least 100.\n*   The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Prime Factorization:** Every integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. This is crucial for finding the GCD.\n*   **Factorial:** `n!` is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`.\n*   **GCD Properties:**\n    *   `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)` (Euclidean algorithm)\n    *   `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)` (if a < b)\n    *   `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b)` (if a = b)\n    *   `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b)` (if a > b)\n*   **Prime Factorization of GCD:** The GCD of two numbers is the product of the smallest powers of the common prime factors.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Prime Factorization of 100:** Find the prime factorization of 100. This will help us determine the prime factors and their powers that the GCD must have.\n*   **Step 2: Prime Factorization of n^3:** Express `n^3` as a product of its prime factors.\n*   **Step 3: Prime Factorization of n!:** Express `n!` as a product of its prime factors.\n*   **Step 4: Determine the GCD:** Find the GCD of `n^3` and `n!` by taking the minimum power of each common prime factor.\n*   **Step 5: Check the GCD:** Check if the GCD is at least 100.\n*   **Step 6: Increment n:** If the GCD is not at least 100, increment `n` and repeat steps 2-5.\n\n**4. Optimization:**\n\n*   **Prime Factorization of n!:** Instead of calculating the full prime factorization of `n!`, we can use Legendre's formula to find the exponent of each prime factor in `n!`. Legendre's formula states that the exponent of a prime `p` in `n!` is given by the sum of the floor of `n/p^k` for `k = 1, 2, 3, ...` until `p^k > n`.\n*   **Efficient GCD Calculation:** Since we are only interested in the GCD being at least 100, we can focus on the prime factors of 100 (2 and 5) and their powers.\n\n**5. Implementation:**\n\n*   The plan can be implemented using a loop that iterates over increasing values of `n`. For each `n`, we calculate the prime factorization of `n^3` and `n!`, determine the GCD, and check if it is at least 100.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes.

Compute the least possible value for $b_{20}+a_{14}$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We have two arithmetic sequences, each with 20 terms.\n*   The sequences contain 40 distinct positive integers.\n*   We are given a relationship between the 20th term of the first sequence and the 14th term of the second sequence: $a_{20} + b_{14} = 1000$.\n*   We need to find the minimum possible value of $b_{20} + a_{14}$.\n\n**2. Represent the Sequences:**\n\n*   Let $a_1$ and $d_a$ be the first term and common difference of the first sequence.\n*   Let $b_1$ and $d_b$ be the first term and common difference of the second sequence.\n*   Then, the general terms of the sequences are:\n    *   $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d_a$\n    *   $b_n = b_1 + (n-1)d_b$\n\n**3. Express the Given and Target Expressions:**\n\n*   Given: $a_{20} + b_{14} = 1000$\n    *   $a_{20} = a_1 + 19d_a$\n    *   $b_{14} = b_1 + 13d_b$\n    *   So, $a_1 + 19d_a + b_1 + 13d_b = 1000$\n*   Target: Minimize $b_{20} + a_{14}$\n    *   $b_{20} = b_1 + 19d_b$\n    *   $a_{14} = a_1 + 13d_a$\n    *   So, $b_1 + 19d_b + a_1 + 13d_a$\n\n**4. Simplify the Target Expression:**\n\n*   Combine the terms: $a_1 + b_1 + 13d_a + 19d_b$\n\n**5. Relate the Target Expression to the Given Expression:**\n\n*   From the given expression: $a_1 + b_1 + 19d_a + 13d_b = 1000$\n*   Notice that the target expression is similar to the given expression, but with the coefficients of $d_a$ and $d_b$ swapped.\n\n**6. Strategy for Minimization:**\n\n*   We need to minimize $a_1 + b_1 + 13d_a + 19d_b$.\n*   We know that $a_1 + b_1 + 19d_a + 13d_b = 1000$.\n*   We can rewrite the target expression as: $1000 - 6d_a + 6d_b$.\n*   Therefore, to minimize the target expression, we need to minimize $-6d_a + 6d_b$.\n*   This is equivalent to maximizing $d_a - d_b$.\n\n**7. Consider the Constraints:**\n\n*   The sequences must consist of 40 distinct positive integers.\n*   This means that $a_1, a_1 + d_a, a_1 + 2d_a, \\ldots, a_1 + 19d_a$ must all be distinct and positive.\n*   Similarly, $b_1, b_1 + d_b, b_1 + 2d_b, \\ldots, b_1 + 19d_b$ must all be distinct and positive.\n*   This implies that $d_a$ and $d_b$ must be positive integers.\n*   Also, $a_1$ and $b_1$ must be positive integers.\n\n**8. Strategy for Maximizing $d_a - d_b$:**\n\n*   To maximize $d_a - d_b$, we need to maximize $d_a$ and minimize $d_b$.\n*   However, we must ensure that the sequences remain distinct and positive.\n\n**9. Consider the Relationship Between the Sequences:**\n\n*   The sequences are distinct, so $a_n \\neq b_m$ for all $n, m$.\n*   This means that the terms of the two sequences cannot overlap.\n\n**10. Plan for the Solution:**\n\n*   Try different values of $d_a$ and $d_b$ that are positive integers.\n*   For each pair of $d_a$ and $d_b$, calculate $a_1$ and $b_1$ using the given equation $a_1 + 19d_a + b_1 + 13d_b = 1000$.\n*   Check if the sequences are distinct and consist of positive integers.\n*   Calculate $b_{20} + a_{14}$ for each valid pair of $d_a$ and $d_b$.\n*   Find the minimum value of $b_{20} + a_{14}$.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Considerations:**\n\n*   The equations are symmetric in some way, so we might consider symmetry in our search.\n*   We should consider both positive and negative values for x, y, and z.\n*   We should be careful to avoid duplicate solutions.\n*   We should be efficient in our search to avoid unnecessary calculations.\n\nThis plan provides a structured approach to solving the problem.

Compute $\\pi / V$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We are given a fixed value of T (T=13).\n*   We need to find the maximum volume of a right circular cone.\n*   The cone's radius is 'r'.\n*   The cone's height is given as T - r\u00b2.\n*   We need to find the value of \u03c0/V, where V is the maximum volume.\n\n**2. Identify Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Volume of a Cone:** The formula for the volume of a cone is V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n*   **Optimization:** We need to find the maximum volume. This is an optimization problem.\n*   **Calculus (Derivatives):** We will use derivatives to find the maximum volume. We will take the derivative of the volume function with respect to 'r', set it equal to zero, and solve for 'r'.\n\n**3. Develop a Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Express Volume in Terms of 'r':** Substitute the given height (T - r\u00b2) into the volume formula. This will give us a function of 'r' only.\n*   **Step 2: Differentiate the Volume Function:** Take the derivative of the volume function with respect to 'r'.\n*   **Step 3: Find Critical Points:** Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for 'r'. This will give us the critical points.\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Maximum Volume:** Substitute the critical point(s) back into the volume function to find the maximum volume.\n*   **Step 5: Calculate \u03c0/V:** Once we have the maximum volume, divide \u03c0 by the volume to get the final answer.\n\n**4. Consider Potential Challenges:**\n\n*   **Domain Restrictions:** We need to ensure that the radius and height are positive. This will restrict the possible values of 'r'.\n*   **Correct Application of Calculus:** We need to correctly apply the rules of differentiation to find the derivative of the volume function.\n*   **Interpreting the Result:** We need to ensure that we correctly interpret the result of \u03c0/V.\n\n**5. Outline the Solution Steps:**\n\n1.  Substitute T=13 into the height formula: h = 13 - r\u00b2.\n2.  Substitute h and r into the volume formula: V = (1/3)\u03c0r\u00b2(13 - r\u00b2).\n3.  Simplify the volume function: V = (1/3)\u03c0(13r\u00b2 - r\u2074).\n4.  Take the derivative of V with respect to r: dV/dr = (1/3)\u03c0(26r - 4r\u00b3).\n5.  Set dV/dr = 0 and solve for r: 26r - 4r\u00b3 = 0.\n6.  Solve for r: r(26 - 4r\u00b2) = 0. This gives r = 0 or r\u00b2 = 26/4 = 13/2. Since r > 0, r = sqrt(13/2).\n7.  Substitute r = sqrt(13/2) back into the volume formula to find the maximum volume.\n8.  Calculate \u03c0/V using the maximum volume found in step 7.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Consider the Constraints:**\n\n*   **Digit Limit:** Each digit can only be between 0 and 9.\n*   **Digit Sum Limit:** The sum of the previous two digits must be less than or equal to the current digit.

Factorials grow very quickly.\n*   **Digit Constraints:** A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), and A > 0.\n*   **Range of Values:** Since we're looking for the largest possible number, we should consider the largest possible values for B, C, and D.\n*   **Factorial Bounds:** Since B, C, and D are digits, their factorials can be at most 9! = 362880. However, the sum of three factorials (B! + C! + D!) must be a 4-digit number (1000-9999). This gives us a range for the sum.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Start with the largest possible values for B, C, and D:** Since factorials grow quickly, we should start by testing the largest possible values for B, C, and D (e.g., 9, 8, 7, etc.).\n*   **Iterate through combinations:** Systematically try different combinations of B, C, and D, calculating B! + C! + D! and checking if the result is a 4-digit number.\n*   **Check for the largest valid number:** Keep track of the largest valid number found during the iteration.\n*   **Optimize:** Since factorials grow quickly, we can limit the range of values we need to test. For example, if B! + C! + D! > 9999, we can stop testing combinations with larger values of B, C, and D.\n\n**4. Implementation Steps:**\n\n*   Initialize a variable to store the largest valid number found (initially set to 0).\n*   Iterate through possible values of B (from 9 down to 0).\n*   For each value of B, iterate through possible values of C (from 9 down to 0).\n*   For each combination of B and C, iterate through possible values of D (from 9 down to 0).\n*   Calculate the sum: B! + C! + D!.\n*   If the sum is a 4-digit number (1000-9999), check if it's a valid number (i.e., the digits of the sum match the digits B, C, and D).\n*   If the sum is valid, compare it to the current largest valid number and update the largest valid number if necessary.\n*   After testing all combinations, the largest valid number found is the answer.\n\n**5. Optimization (Optional):**\n\n*   Since factorials grow quickly, we can limit the range of values we need to test. For example, if B! + C! + D! > 9999, we can stop testing combinations with larger values of B, C, and D.\n*   We can pre-calculate the factorials of digits 0-9 to avoid recalculating them repeatedly.\n\n**6. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The largest valid number found during the iteration is the answer.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Number of Digits:** The number of digits $D$ in a positive integer $N$ is given by $D = \\lfloor \\log_{10} N \\rfloor + 1$.\n*   **Logarithmic Properties:**\n    *   $\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b}$ for any positive $c \\neq 1$.\n    *   $\\log_b (a^c) = c \\cdot \\log_b a$.\n    *   $\\log_b (a \\cdot c) = \\log_b a + \\log_b c$.\n*   **Exponentiation:** We will need to manipulate and simplify the given expressions using exponent rules.\n\n**3. Plan of Attack:**\n\n**Step 1: Find X (Number of Digits in $100^{1000^{10,000}}$)**\n\n*   Rewrite $100$ as $10^2$: $100^{1000^{10,000}} = (10^2)^{1000^{10,000}} = 10^{2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}}$.\n*   Apply the number of digits formula: $X = \\lfloor \\log_{10} (10^{2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}}) \\rfloor + 1$.\n*   Simplify the logarithm: $\\log_{10} (10^{2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}}) = 2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}$.\n*   Therefore, $X = \\lfloor 2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000} \\rfloor + 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Find Y (Number of Digits in $1000^{10,000^{100,000}}$)**\n\n*   Rewrite $1000$ as $10^3$: $1000^{10,000^{100,000}} = (10^3)^{10,000^{100,000}} = 10^{3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}}$.\n*   Apply the number of digits formula: $Y = \\lfloor \\log_{10} (10^{3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}}) \\rfloor + 1$.\n*   Simplify the logarithm: $\\log_{10} (10^{3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}}) = 3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}$.\n*   Therefore, $Y = \\lfloor 3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000} \\rfloor + 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute $\\left\\lfloor\\log _{X} Y\\right\\rfloor$**\n\n*   Use the change of base formula: $\\log_{X} Y = \\frac{\\log_{10} Y}{\\log_{10} X}$.\n*   Substitute the expressions for $X$ and $Y$:\n    *   $\\log_{10} X = \\log_{10} (2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000} + 1)$\n    *   $\\log_{10} Y = \\log_{10} (3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000} + 1)$\n*   Simplify the logarithms using logarithmic properties.\n*   Calculate the value of $\\frac{\\log_{10} Y}{\\log_{10} X}$.\n*   Take the floor of the result.\n\n**4. Simplification and Estimation:**\n\n*   Since $1000^{10,000}$ and $10,000^{100,000}$ are extremely large, the constants $2$ and $3$ in the expressions for $X$ and $Y$ will be negligible compared to the exponential terms.\n*   Therefore, we can approximate:\n    *   $X \\approx 2 \\cdot 1000^{10,000}$\n    *   $Y \\approx 3 \\cdot 10,000^{100,000}$\n*   This simplification will make the calculations more manageable.\n\n**5.

Understand the Geometry of a Regular n-gon:**\n\n*   **Diagonals and Angles:** In a regular n-gon, diagonals are line segments connecting non-adjacent vertices. The angle between two intersecting diagonals depends on the number of sides and the specific diagonals chosen.\n*   **Central Angles:** The central angle (angle at the center of the polygon) between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n*   **Interior Angles:** The interior angle of a regular n-gon is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees.\n\n**2. Identify Key Relationships:**\n\n*   **Angle Between Diagonals:** The angle between two intersecting diagonals can be related to the central angles. The angle between two diagonals is half the difference of the central angles subtended by the arcs they intersect.\n*   **Angle of 159 Degrees:** We are given that the angle between two diagonals is 159 degrees. This will be crucial in our calculations.\n\n**3. Formulate an Equation:**\n\n*   Let the central angles subtended by the arcs be x and y degrees.\n*   The angle between the diagonals is (x - y)/2 = 159 degrees.\n*   We need to find a relationship between x and y that can be expressed in terms of n.\n\n**4. Consider the Regular n-gon's Symmetry:**\n\n*   The regular n-gon is symmetric, so we can assume the diagonals intersect at the center of the polygon.\n*   This simplifies the problem, as the angle between the diagonals is directly related to the central angles.\n\n**5. Express x and y in Terms of n:**\n\n*   Since the polygon is regular, the central angles x and y can be expressed in terms of n and the number of sides between the vertices connected by the diagonals.\n*   For example, if the diagonals connect vertices that are k and m sides apart, then x = (k * 360)/n and y = (m * 360)/n.\n\n**6.

This gives us: 0 = a(0)\u00b2 + b(0) + c => c = 0.\n*   **Point (15, 225):** Substitute x = 15 and f(x) = 225 into the quadratic function. This gives us: 225 = a(15)\u00b2 + b(15) + c. Since we know c = 0, this simplifies to: 225 = 225a + 15b.\n\n**3. Simplify the Equation from Step 2:**\n\n*   From the equation 225 = 225a + 15b, we can divide both sides by 15 to get: 15 = 15a + b.\n\n**4. Consider the Integer Roots:**\n\n*   Since the quadratic function has integer roots, it can be written in factored form: f(x) = a(x - r)(x - s), where r and s are integers.\n*   Expanding this factored form gives: f(x) = a(x\u00b2 - (r+s)x + rs) = ax\u00b2 - a(r+s)x + a(rs).\n*   Comparing this with the standard form f(x) = ax\u00b2 + bx + c, we get:\n    *   b = -a(r+s)\n    *   c = a(rs)\n\n**5.

Determine the Possible Values of r and s:**\n\n*   For each valid value of a, use the equation b = -a(r+s) to find the possible values of b.\n*   Since b must be an integer, and a is already an integer, r+s must be an integer.\n*   For each valid value of a and b, find the possible integer values of r and s that satisfy the equation b = -a(r+s).\n\n**9.

The sum of these six numbers is 6m + 21.\n*   **Solve for 'm':** The sum of the first six numbers (21) plus the sum of the remaining six numbers (6m + 21) plus the median (m) must equal 120.

The function is defined as follows:\n\n- If $ n = 3^k n' $, where $ k \\geq 0 $ is an integer and $ n' $ is an integer not divisible by 3, then $ d(n) = 3^{-k} $.\n- $ d(0) = 0 $.\n\nWe are asked to find the house or houses with positive numbers less than 100 that are closest to City Hall.\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Distance Function\n\nThe function $ d(n) $ is defined based on the prime factorization of $ n $, specifically the power of 3 in its factorization. The closer $ n $ is to a power of 3, the smaller $ d(n) $ becomes.\n\nFor example:\n- $ d(1) = 1 $ (since $ 1 = 3^0 \\cdot 1 $)\n- $ d(3) = 1/3 $ (since $ 3 = 3^1 \\cdot 1 $)\n- $ d(9) = 1/9 $ (since $ 9 = 3^2 \\cdot 1 $)\n- $ d(27) = 1/27 $ (since $ 27 = 3^3 \\cdot 1 $)\n- $ d(81) = 1/81 $ (since $ 81 = 3^4 \\cdot 1 $)\n\n## Step 2: Identify the Closest Houses\n\nWe are looking for the house or houses with positive numbers less than 100 that are closest to City Hall. This means we are looking for the house or houses with the smallest value of $ d(n) $.\n\nFrom the definition of $ d(n) $, we know that the smaller the power of 3 in the factorization of $ n $, the larger $ d(n) $ is. Conversely, the larger the power of 3 in the factorization of $ n $, the smaller $ d(n) $ is.\n\nSo, we want to find the house or houses with the largest power of 3 in their factorization.\n\nLet's consider the powers of 3:\n- $ 3^0 = 1 $\n- $ 3^1 = 3 $\n- $ 3^2 = 9 $\n- $ 3^3 = 27 $\n- $ 3^4 = 81 $\n- $ 3^5 = 243 $\n\nWe are only interested in houses with positive numbers less than 100. So, we can ignore $ 3^5 = 243 $.\n\nNow, let's consider the houses with the largest power of 3 in their factorization:\n- $ 81 = 3^4 \\cdot 1 $, so $ d(81) = 1/81 $\n- $ 27 = 3^3 \\cdot 1 $, so $ d(27) = 1/27 $\n- $ 9 = 3^2 \\cdot 1 $, so $ d(9) = 1/9 $\n- $ 3 = 3^1 \\cdot 1 $, so $ d(3) = 1/3 $\n- $ 1 = 3^0 \\cdot 1 $, so $ d(1) = 1 $\n\nSo, the house with the largest power of 3 in its factorization is house 81, and $ d(81) = 1/81 $.\n\n## Step 3: Conclusion\n\nThe house or houses with positive numbers less than 100 that are closest to City Hall are the houses with the largest power of 3 in their factorization. The house with the largest power of 3 in its factorization is house 81, and $ d(81) = 1/81 $.\n\nTherefore, the house or houses with positive numbers less than 100 that are closest to City Hall are the houses with the largest power of 3 in their factorization. The house with the largest power of 3 in its factorization is house 81, and $ d(81) = 1/81 $.\n\nSo, the answer is: The house or houses with positive numbers less than 100 that are closest to City Hall are the houses with the largest power of 3 in their factorization.

Determine the possible values of $d(16, m)$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Distance Function:**\n\n*   **Key Concept:** The distance function `d(n)` is defined based on the prime factorization of `n`. Specifically, if `n = 3^k * n'` where `k` is a non-negative integer and `n'` is not divisible by 3, then `d(n) = 3^{-k}`.\n*   **Examples:** `d(18) = 1/9` because `18 = 3^2 * 2`, and `d(-33) = 1/3` because `-33 = 3^1 * -11`.\n\n**2. Interpret the Distance Between Houses:**\n\n*   **Key Concept:** The distance between two houses `m` and `n` is `d(m, n) = d(m - n)`. This means we can find the distance between any two houses by finding the distance of their difference from City Hall.\n*   **Example:** `d(3, 4) = d(-1) = 1` because `-1 = 3^0 * -1`.\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Information:**\n\n*   **Given:** `d(17, m) = 1/81`. This means `d(17 - m) = 1/81`.\n*   **Goal:** Find the possible values of `d(16, m)`, which is `d(16 - m)`.\n\n**4. Determine the Value of (17 - m):**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Since `d(17 - m) = 1/81`, we know that `17 - m = 3^k * n'` where `k` is a non-negative integer and `n'` is not divisible by 3.\n*   **Step 2:** From the definition of `d(n)`, we know that `d(17 - m) = 3^{-k}`. Therefore, `3^{-k} = 1/81`.\n*   **Step 3:** Solve for `k`.  `3^{-k} = 1/81` implies `k = 4` because `3^4 = 81`.\n\n**5. Determine the Value of (16 - m):**\n\n*   **Step 1:** From the previous step, we know that `17 - m = 3^4 * n' = 81 * n'`.\n*   **Step 2:** Therefore, `16 - m = (17 - m) - 1 = 81 * n' - 1`.\n*   **Step 3:** We need to find the value of `d(16 - m) = d(81 * n' - 1)`.\n\n**6. Analyze the Value of (81 * n' - 1):**\n\n*   **Step 1:** We need to find the prime factorization of `81 * n' - 1`. This will help us determine the value of `d(81 * n' - 1)`.\n*   **Step 2:** Since `n'` is not divisible by 3, `81 * n'` is divisible by 3. Therefore, `81 * n' - 1` is not divisible by 3.\n*   **Step 3:** We can write `81 * n' - 1 = 3^k * n''` where `k` is a non-negative integer and `n''` is not divisible by 3. We need to find the value of `k`.\n\n**7. Determine the Value of k:**\n\n*   **Step 1:** Since `81 * n' - 1` is not divisible by 3, `k = 0`.\n*   **Step 2:** Therefore, `d(81 * n' - 1) = 3^{-0} = 1`.\n\n**8. Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Final Answer:** The only possible value of `d(16, m)` is `1`.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

However, eighteen families arrive and are looking to move in. After much debate, the connotations of using negative house numbers are deemed unacceptable, and the city decides on an alternative plan. On July 17, Shewad Movers arrive and relocate every family from house $n$ to house $n+18$, for all positive $n$ (so that City Hall does not move). For example, the family in house number 17 moves to house number 35.\nRoss takes a walk starting at his house, which is number 34 . He first visits house $n_{1}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, 34\\right)=1 / 3$. He then goes to another house, $n_{2}$, such that $d\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}\\right)=1 / 3$. Continuing in that way, he visits houses $n_{3}, n_{4}, \\ldots$, and each time, $d\\left(n_{i}, n_{i+1}\\right)=1 / 3$. At the end of the day, what is his maximum possible distance from his original house? Justify your answer. </input>\n\n# **Problem Analysis**\n\nWe are given a unique distance function $ d(n) $, which is defined based on the prime factorization of $ n $, particularly its power of 3. The distance function is defined as:\n\n$$\nd(n) = 3^{-k}, \\quad \\text{where } n = 3^k n', \\text{ and } n' \\text{ is not divisible by 3.}\n$$\n\nThis means that the distance from a house to City Hall (which is at 0) is determined by the power of 3 in the prime factorization of the house number.\n\nWe are also given a key property:\n\n$$\nd(m, n) = d(m - n)\n$$\n\nThis means the distance between two houses is the same as the distance from the difference of their house numbers to City Hall.\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $ n $, denoted $ \\mathcal{N}(n) $, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $ n $, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(n) = \\{ m \\mid d(m) = d(n) \\}\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that $ m $ and $ n $ have the same power of 3 in their prime factorization.\n\n---\n\n# **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Distance Function Behavior**:\n   - If $ n = 3^k n' $, then $ d(n) = 3^{-k} $.\n   - If $ n $ is not divisible by 3, then $ d(n) = 1 $.\n   - If $ n = 0 $, then $ d(n) = 0 $.\n\n2. **Distance Between Houses**:\n   - $ d(m, n) = d(m - n) $, so the distance between two houses is the same as the distance from their difference to City Hall.\n\n3. **Neighborhoods**:\n   - $ \\mathcal{N}(n) $ is the set of all houses with the same power of 3 in their prime factorization.\n   - For example, $ \\mathcal{N}(18) = \\{ 18, 6, 2, -6, -2, -18, \\ldots \\} $, because all of these have $ 3^1 $ as a factor.\n\n4. **Relocation**:\n   - Every house $ n $ is moved to $ n + 18 $.\n   - This means the house number increases by 18, but the distance function remains the same, because the power of 3 in the prime factorization of $ n + 18 $ is the same as the power of 3 in $ n $.\n\n5. **Ross's Walk**:\n   - Ross starts at house 34.\n   - He moves to a house $ n_1 $ such that $ d(n_1, 34) = 1/3 $, i.e., $ d(34 - n_1) = 1/3 $.\n   - Then he moves to a house $ n_2 $ such that $ d(n_1, n_2) = 1/3 $, i.e., $ d(n_1 - n_2) = 1/3 $.\n   - He continues this process, always moving to a house that is 1/3 away from the previous one.\n   - The goal is to find the **maximum possible distance** from his original house (34) after this walk.\n\n---\n\n# **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n## **Step 1: Determine the distance from Ross's original house (34) to City Hall**\n\nWe need to find $ d(34) $.\n\n- $ 34 = 2 \\cdot 17 $, and neither 2 nor 17 is divisible by 3.\n- So, $ d(34) = 1 $.\n\n## **Step 2: Determine the set of houses that are 1/3 away from City Hall**\n\nWe are looking for all $ m $ such that $ d(m) = 1/3 $.\n\n- $ d(m) = 1/3 $ means $ m = 3^1 \\cdot m' $, where $ m' $ is not divisible by 3.\n- So, $ m = 3m' $, and $ m' \\neq 0 $, $ m' \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod 3 $.\n\nThus, the set of houses that are 1/3 away from City Hall is:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(3) = \\{ \\pm 3, \\pm 6, \\pm 9, \\pm 12, \\pm 15, \\pm 18, \\pm 21, \\pm 24, \\pm 27, \\pm 30, \\pm 33, \\pm 36, \\ldots \\}\n$$\n\n## **Step 3: Determine the first move: $ n_1 $ such that $ d(n_1, 34) = 1/3 $**\n\nWe are looking for $ n_1 $ such that $ d(34 -

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the smallest integer greater than 2013 that cannot be expressed as the sum of two palindromes.\n*   A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards (e.g., 121, 1331).\n*   The number cannot end in 0.\n\n**2.

Define the sequence $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \\ldots$ by setting $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=1}^{20} \\underbrace{(f \\circ \\cdots \\circ f)}_{n}(k)$. That is, $s_{1}=f(1)+$ $\\cdots+f(20), s_{2}=f(f(1))+\\cdots+f(f(20)), s_{3}=f(f(f(1)))+f(f(f(2)))+\\cdots+f(f(f(20)))$, etc. Compute the smallest integer $p$ such that the following statement is true: The sequence $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \\ldots$ must be periodic after a certain point, and its period is at most $p$. (If the sequence is never periodic, then write $\\infty$ as your answer.) </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We have a set S = {1, 2, ..., 20}.\n*   A function f maps elements of S to elements of S.\n*   A sequence s_n is defined as the sum of f applied n times to each element of S.\n*   We need to find the smallest integer p such that the sequence s_n becomes periodic with period at most p after some point.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Theorems:**\n\n*   **Function Iteration:** The sequence s_n involves repeated applications of the function f.\n*   **Pigeonhole Principle:** Since the function f maps a finite set to itself, the number of possible values for f(k) is limited. This will be crucial in determining periodicity.\n*   **Periodicity:** A sequence is periodic if it repeats its values after a certain point. The period is the length of the repeating segment.\n*   **Graph Theory (Optional):** We can model the function f as a directed graph where each node represents an element of S and an edge from a to b means f(a) = b. This can help visualize the behavior of the function.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Analyze the Function f:**\n    *   Consider the behavior of f. Since f maps S to S, the function f must eventually repeat values.\n    *   Consider the concept of \"cycles\" in the function f. If f has a cycle of length m, then applying f m times to any element in the cycle will return to the original element.\n*   **Step 2: Consider the Sequence s_n:**\n    *   The sequence s_n is the sum of f applied n times to each element of S.\n    *   If f has a cycle of length m, then applying f m times to any element in the cycle will return to the original element. This will affect the values of s_n.\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Periodicity of s_n:**\n    *   If f has a cycle of length m, then the sequence s_n will eventually become periodic with period m.\n    *   The period of s_n is the least common multiple (LCM) of the periods of the individual elements in the sequence.\n*   **Step 4: Find the Smallest Possible Period p:**\n    *   The smallest possible period p is the LCM of the lengths of the cycles in the function f.\n    *   Since the function f maps a finite set to itself, the maximum possible period is 20 (the size of the set S).\n    *   We need to find the smallest p such that the sequence s_n is guaranteed to be periodic with period at most p, regardless of the function f.\n\n**4. Key Observations:**\n\n*   The sequence s_n will eventually become periodic because the function f has a finite number of possible values.\n*   The period of s_n is related to the cycles in the function f.\n*   The smallest possible period p is the LCM of the lengths of the cycles in the function f.\n*   The maximum possible period is 20.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The answer will be the smallest integer p such that the sequence s_n is guaranteed to be periodic with period at most p, regardless of the function f.\n*   The answer will be the LCM of the lengths of the cycles in the function f.\n*   The answer will be at most 20.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

For integer solutions, $D$ must be a perfect square.\n*   **Step 3: Find Perfect Squares:** Find the smallest perfect square $D = k^2$ such that $k^2 > 169$ (since $n > 2023$).\n*   **Step 4: Solve for n:** Rearrange the discriminant equation to solve for $n$: $n = \\frac{k^2 - 169}{4}$.\n*   **Step 5: Check for Integer Solutions:** Ensure that the solutions for $x$ are integers. This can be done by checking if the roots calculated using the quadratic formula are integers.\n*   **Step 6: Find the Least n:** Find the smallest $n > 2023$ that satisfies the above conditions.\n\n**4.

Compute the least possible degree-measure of the smallest interior angle in hexagon TIEBRK. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We have a convex hexagon (6-sided polygon).\n*   All interior angles are integers.\n*   The interior angles form an arithmetic progression (AP).\n*   We need to find the smallest possible measure of the smallest interior angle.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Sum of Interior Angles:** The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with *n* sides is given by the formula:  (n-2) * 180 degrees.  For a hexagon, this is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.\n*   **Arithmetic Progression (AP):** In an AP, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.  If the first term is 'a' and the common difference is 'd', the terms are: a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d.\n*   **Sum of AP:** The sum of the terms in an AP can be calculated using the formula:  n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d), where 'n' is the number of terms, 'a' is the first term, and 'd' is the common difference.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Express the Sum of Angles in Terms of AP:**  Use the AP formula to express the sum of the interior angles in terms of 'a' and 'd'.  The sum of the six angles will be: 6/2 * (2a + (6-1)d) = 3*(2a + 5d).\n*   **Step 2: Set Up an Equation:**  Set the sum of the angles equal to 720 degrees: 3*(2a + 5d) = 720.\n*   **Step 3: Simplify the Equation:**  Simplify the equation to: 2a + 5d = 240.\n*   **Step 4: Find Integer Solutions:**  We need to find integer values of 'a' and 'd' that satisfy the equation 2a + 5d = 240.  Since we want the smallest possible value of 'a', we should try to minimize 'a'.\n*   **Step 5: Consider Constraints:**  The hexagon is convex, so each interior angle must be less than 180 degrees.  This means that the largest angle, which is a+5d, must be less than 180 degrees.\n*   **Step 6: Test Values:**  Start with the smallest possible value of 'a' (e.g., 1) and find a corresponding integer value of 'd' that satisfies the equation and the convexity constraint.  If no such 'd' exists, increment 'a' and repeat.\n*   **Step 7: Find the Minimum 'a':**  Continue testing values of 'a' until you find the smallest possible value of 'a' that satisfies all the conditions.\n\n**4. Optimization:**\n\n*   To minimize 'a', we should maximize 'd' while still keeping the largest angle (a+5d) less than 180 degrees.\n*   We can use the convexity constraint (a+5d < 180) to find an upper bound for 'd'.\n\n**5. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The smallest possible value of 'a' that satisfies all the conditions will be the answer.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Analyze the Equation:**\n\n*   We have the equation: `P(n+23) = P(n) + 23`.\n*   This means the product of the digits of `n+23` is 23 more than the product of the digits of `n`.\n\n**4.

For example, it can cause a carryover, change the last digit, or change multiple digits.\n*   We need to consider how the addition of 23 affects the digits of `n` and how this affects the product of the digits.\n\n**5. Consider the Possibility of Zero in the Product:**\n\n*   If `P(n)` is zero, then `P(n+23)` must also be zero.  This would mean that `n+23` has a zero digit.

Strategy:**\n\n*   **Assume the order of the three consecutive integers:** Since the mean, median, and mode are three consecutive integers, we can assume different orders for them. For example, the mode could be the smallest, the median, or the largest.\n*   **Consider the mode:** Since the mode is unique, it must appear at least twice. We need to ensure that the other numbers in the list do not have the same frequency as the mode.\n*   **Consider the median:** The median is the middle number when the list is sorted.

He considers two tables to be the same if one can be rotated so that it has the same numbers in the same positions as the other. For example, a table with the numbers $8,4,5$ (in clockwise order) is considered the same as a table with the numbers 4, 5,8 (in clockwise order), but both tables are different from a table with the numbers 8, 5, 4 (in clockwise order). Given that the numbers he carves sum to 17 , compute the number of different tables he can make. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to count the number of distinct circular arrangements of positive integers that sum to 17.\n*   Rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical.\n*   The integers must be positive and placed at equally spaced points around the circumference.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Circular Permutations:** The number of ways to arrange `n` distinct objects in a circle is `(n-1)!`. However, this is not directly applicable here because the integers are not necessarily distinct.\n*   **Integer Partition:** We need to find the number of ways to partition the integer 17 into a sum of positive integers. This is a classic integer partition problem.\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** Since rotations are considered the same, we need to account for this symmetry. This is where Burnside's Lemma or the concept of \"necklaces\" in combinatorics might be useful.\n\n**3. Plan of Action:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Find all integer partitions of 17.** This will give us the possible sets of numbers that can be used to create the tables.\n*   **Step 2: For each partition, determine the number of distinct circular arrangements.** This involves:\n    *   Considering the number of elements in the partition (n).\n    *   Calculating the number of distinct linear arrangements of the partition (which is the factorial of the number of elements, but we need to account for repeated elements).\n    *   Dividing by the number of rotations (n) to account for rotational symmetry.\n*   **Step 3: Sum the results from Step 2.** This will give us the total number of distinct tables.\n\n**4. Considerations:**\n\n*   **Repeated Elements:** If the partition contains repeated elements, we need to adjust the calculation for linear arrangements to account for these repetitions.\n*   **Burnside's Lemma:** This might be a more efficient approach, especially for larger partitions. Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct arrangements is equal to the average number of arrangements fixed by each symmetry operation (in this case, rotations).\n*   **Efficiency:** The number of partitions of 17 is relatively small, so a brute-force approach is feasible.\n\n**5. Implementation:**\n\n*   We can use a recursive function or a dynamic programming approach to find all integer partitions of 17.\n*   For each partition, we can calculate the number of distinct circular arrangements using the formula: (number of linear arrangements) / (number of elements in the partition).\n*   We can use a dictionary to store the number of linear arrangements for each unique partition.\n*   Finally, we sum the results for all partitions to get the final answer.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

For example, $8 ! !=8 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2=384$ and $9 ! !=9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1=945$. Compute the number of positive integers $n$ such that $n !$ ! divides 2012!!. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the number of positive integers `n` such that the double factorial of `n` (n!!) divides the double factorial of 2012 (2012!!).\n*   We are given the definition of the double factorial: for even `n`, n!! = n(n-2)(n-4)...2; for odd `n`, n!! = n(n-2)(n-4)...1.\n\n**2. Analyze the Double Factorial of 2012:**\n\n*   Since 2012 is even, 2012!! = 2012 * 2010 * 2008 * ... * 2.\n*   This is a product of all even numbers from 2 to 2012.\n\n**3.

Consider the Prime Factorization of n!!:**\n\n*   For each `n`, we need to determine the prime factorization of n!!.\n*   We need to determine the exponents of all prime numbers in the prime factorization of n!!.\n\n**5. Determine the Conditions for Divisibility:**\n\n*   For n!! to divide 2012!!, the exponents of all prime numbers in the prime factorization of n!! must be less than or equal to the exponents of the corresponding prime numbers in the prime factorization of 2012!!.\n\n**6. Determine the Range of Possible Values for n:**\n\n*   Since n!! divides 2012!!, n must be less than or equal to 2012.\n*   We need to find the maximum value of `n` such that n!! divides 2012!!.\n\n**7.

        "question": "<input> On the complex plane, the parallelogram formed by the points $0, z, \\frac{1}{z}$, and $z+\\frac{1}{z}$ has area $\\frac{35}{37}$, and the real part of $z$ is positive.

Understand the Geometry:**\n\n*   The problem involves a parallelogram on the complex plane.  The vertices are 0, z, 1/z, and z + 1/z.\n*   The area of the parallelogram is given as 35/37.\n*   The real part of z is positive.\n\n**2. Represent Complex Numbers as Vectors:**\n\n*   Represent the complex numbers as vectors in the complex plane.  For example, z can be represented as a vector from the origin to the point (Re(z), Im(z)).\n\n**3. Use the Area Formula for a Parallelogram:**\n\n*   The area of a parallelogram formed by vectors **a** and **b** is given by the magnitude of the cross product: |**a** x **b**| = |a||b|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the vectors.\n*   In the complex plane, the area can also be calculated using the imaginary part of the product of two complex numbers.  Specifically, if we have vectors represented by complex numbers a and b, then the area is |Im(a * conjugate(b))|.\n\n**4. Express the Area in Terms of z:**\n\n*   The vectors representing the sides of the parallelogram are z and 1/z.\n*   The area of the parallelogram is |Im(z * conjugate(1/z))| = |Im(1)| = 1.  Wait, this seems incorrect.  Let's re-examine this.\n\n**5. Correct the Area Formula:**\n\n*   The area of the parallelogram formed by vectors z and 1/z is |Im(z * conjugate(1/z))| = |Im(1)| = 1.

The small cubes are reassembled randomly into a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ cube. Compute the probability that no paint is showing. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We have a 2x2x2 cube.\n*   One face of the cube is painted.\n*   The cube is cut into 8 smaller 1x1x1 cubes.\n*   The small cubes are randomly reassembled into a 2x2x2 cube.\n*   We need to find the probability that no paint is visible on the final cube.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Painted Faces:** The original cube has 6 faces. Only one face is painted.\n*   **Small Cubes:** There are 8 small cubes. Each small cube can be in one of 6 orientations (each face can be on the top, bottom, front, back, left, or right).\n*   **Reassembly:** The small cubes are randomly reassembled. This means that the orientation and position of each small cube is random.\n*   **Paint Visibility:** For no paint to be visible, the painted face of the original cube must be completely hidden within the interior of the final cube. This means the small cube with the painted face must be placed in a position where its painted face is not on the exterior of the final cube.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine the number of small cubes with paint.**  Only one small cube has paint on one face.\n*   **Step 2: Determine the number of positions where the painted face can be hidden.**  The painted face must be on the interior of the final cube.  This means the small cube with the painted face must be placed in a position where its painted face is not on the exterior.  There are 4 such positions (the centers of the four faces of the final cube).\n*   **Step 3: Determine the number of possible orientations for the small cube with paint.**  The small cube with paint can be oriented in 6 different ways (each face can be on the top, bottom, front, back, left, or right).  However, only 2 of these orientations will hide the paint (the painted face is on the top or bottom of the small cube).\n*   **Step 4: Determine the number of possible orientations for the other small cubes.**  The other 7 small cubes can be oriented in any way.  Each of these small cubes has 6 possible orientations.\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the total number of possible reassemblies.**  This is the number of ways to arrange the 8 small cubes in the 8 positions, multiplied by the number of orientations for each small cube.\n*   **Step 6: Calculate the number of reassemblies where no paint is visible.**  This is the number of ways to place the small cube with paint in a position where its painted face is hidden, multiplied by the number of orientations for the small cube with paint that hide the paint, multiplied by the number of orientations for the other small cubes.\n*   **Step 7: Calculate the probability.**  Divide the number of reassemblies where no paint is visible by the total number of possible reassemblies.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Compute the number of valid ARMLvanian license plates. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to calculate the number of valid license plates.\n*   Each license plate has exactly T-3 = 8 digits.\n*   Digits range from 1 to 9.\n*   All digits on a plate are distinct.\n*   For each position k (1 to 8), the digit in that position must be at least k.\n\n**2. Reformulate the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to choose 8 distinct digits from 1 to 9.\n*   We need to arrange these 8 digits in a sequence of length 8.\n*   The arrangement must satisfy the condition that the digit in the kth position is at least k.\n\n**3. Consider the Constraints:**\n\n*   The constraint that the kth digit is at least k is crucial.  This means that the first digit must be at least 1, the second digit at least 2, and so on.\n*   This constraint limits the possible digits we can choose for each position.\n\n**4. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Combinatorics and Permutations:** We need to use combinatorics to count the number of ways to choose and arrange the digits.\n*   **Case Analysis:** We can consider the possible digits for each position, starting from the first digit (which has the most restrictions).\n*   **Recursive or Iterative Approach:** We can build the license plate digit by digit, considering the constraints at each step.\n*   **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** This might be useful to account for the distinctness of the digits.\n\n**5. Key Observations:**\n\n*   The constraint that the kth digit is at least k means that the digit in the kth position can be any digit from k to 9.\n*   The distinctness constraint means that once a digit is used in a position, it cannot be used again in any other position.\n*   The problem is similar to arranging a set of numbers with constraints on their positions.\n\n**6.

Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Express the Logarithm as a Fraction:** Let log_b(a) = p/q, where p and q are integers with no common factors (i.e., the fraction is in lowest terms).\n*   **Step 2: Convert to Exponential Form:** From the definition of logarithms, we have b^(p/q) = a.\n*   **Step 3: Eliminate the Fractional Exponent:** Raise both sides of the equation to the power of q: b^p = a^q.\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the Equation:** The equation b^p = a^q implies that a and b must be powers of the same integer. This is because the prime factorization of a and b must be compatible to satisfy the equation.\n*   **Step 5: Consider Possible Values for p and q:** Since log_b(a) is rational, p and q must be integers. We need to consider different values of p and q that satisfy the equation b^p = a^q.\n*   **Step 6: Find Integer Solutions:** For each possible value of p and q, find integer values of a and b that satisfy the equation b^p = a^q, while also satisfying the constraints 2 \u2264 a, b \u2264 50.\n*   **Step 7: Count the Ordered Pairs:** Count the number of valid (a, b) pairs found in Step 6.\n\n**4. Implementation:**\n\n*   The plan will involve systematically testing different values of p and q, and for each, finding the corresponding a and b values that satisfy the equation b^p = a^q and the constraints on a and b.\n*   The solution will require careful consideration of the constraints and the properties of exponents and prime factorization.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Compute the number of such words that use the letter A more than any other letter. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to count the number of 5-letter words using only the letters A, R, M, and L.\n*   Each word must contain at least two distinct letters.\n*   The key condition is that the letter 'A' must appear more times than any other letter in the word.\n\n**2. Break Down the Problem:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Consider the possible counts of 'A':** Since the word has 5 letters, the maximum number of 'A's is 5. However, we need to ensure that 'A' appears more than any other letter. This means we need to consider cases where 'A' appears 3, 4, or 5 times. (If 'A' appears 2 times, then other letters could also appear 2 times, violating the condition.)\n*   **Step 2: For each count of 'A', consider the possible counts of the other letters:** For each case of 'A' count, we need to determine the possible combinations of the other letters (R, M, L) that can be used while ensuring that no other letter appears more than 'A'.\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the number of words for each case:** For each valid combination of 'A' and other letters, calculate the number of possible words. This involves:\n    *   Choosing the number of 'A's.\n    *   Choosing the number of occurrences for the other letters (ensuring they don't exceed the number of 'A's).\n    *   Calculating the number of permutations of the letters in the word.\n\n**3. Consider the Constraints:**\n\n*   The word must have at least two distinct letters. This means we cannot have a word with only 'A's.\n*   The word must have at least one other letter besides 'A'.\n\n**4. Plan the Calculation:**\n\n*   **Case 1: 'A' appears 3 times.**\n    *   The remaining 2 letters must be chosen from R, M, and L.\n    *   The remaining 2 letters must be distinct (to ensure at least two distinct letters).\n    *   The remaining 2 letters can be arranged in the word in different ways.\n*   **Case 2: 'A' appears 4 times.**\n    *   The remaining 1 letter must be chosen from R, M, and L.\n    *   The remaining 1 letter can be arranged in the word in different ways.\n*   **Case 3: 'A' appears 5 times.**\n    *   This is not possible, as the word must have at least two distinct letters.\n\n**5.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We need to find the next year after 2012 where April 1st falls on a Sunday.\n*   We know that April 1st, 2012 was a Sunday.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Tools:**\n\n*   **Days of the Week:** There are 7 days in a week.\n*   **Leap Years:** A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.\n*   **Day of the Week Progression:** Each year, the day of the week advances by one day (e.g., if April 1st is a Sunday in 2012, it will be a Monday in 2013). However, in a leap year, the day of the week advances by two days (e.g., if April 1st is a Sunday in 2012, it will be a Tuesday in 2013 if 2013 is a leap year).\n\n**3. Plan of Action:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Determine Leap Years:** Identify the leap years between 2012 and the year we are trying to find. This will help us determine how many days the day of the week will advance.\n*   **Step 2: Calculate Day Advancement:** Starting from 2012, calculate the number of days the day of the week will advance each year. This will involve adding 1 day for non-leap years and 2 days for leap years.\n*   **Step 3: Track the Day of the Week:** Starting from Sunday (April 1st, 2012), keep track of the day of the week as we move forward year by year. We need to find the year where the day of the week is Sunday again.\n*   **Step 4: Find the Next Sunday:** Continue the process until we find the year where April 1st falls on a Sunday again.\n\n**4. Optimization (Optional):**\n\n*   We can use modular arithmetic to simplify the calculations. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can use modulo 7 to track the day of the week.\n*   We can also use the fact that the day of the week will cycle every 28 years (since 28 is the least common multiple of 4 and 7). This means that the day of the week for a given date will repeat every 28 years. However, this is only true if the years in question are not affected by the Gregorian calendar reform (which is not relevant here).\n\n**5.

Alternatively, we can express the ages as $a-p$, $2(a-p)$, and $4(a-p)$.\n*   **Sum of Ages $p$ Years Ago:**  The sum of the ages $p$ years ago is $p$.

Understand the Key Concepts:**\n\n*   **Ellipse:** A set of points where the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to two fixed points (foci) is constant.\n*   **Tangency:** The ellipse touches the x-axis and y-axis at exactly one point each.\n*   **Foci:** The two fixed points that define the ellipse.\n*   **First Quadrant:** The region where both x and y coordinates are positive.\n\n**2.

Key Observations and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Tangency to Axes:** The ellipse touches the x-axis and y-axis.

This constant is equal to the length of the major axis (2a).\n\n**4. Plan of Action:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the Center of the Ellipse.** Since the foci are at (3,7) and (d,7), the center is at ((3+d)/2, 7).\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Vertices.** The ellipse touches the x-axis and y-axis. This means the vertices on the x-axis and y-axis are at ((3+d)/2, 0) and (0, (3+d)/2), respectively.\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Distance from the Center to the Vertices.** The distance from the center to the x-axis vertex is ((3+d)/2) - 0 = (3+d)/2. The distance from the center to the y-axis vertex is ((3+d)/2) - 0 = (3+d)/2.\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the Distance from the Foci to the Vertices.** The distance from the focus at (3,7) to the x-axis vertex is sqrt(((3+d)/2 - 3)^2 + (0 - 7)^2).

Visualize the Removed Regions:**\n\n*   For each vertex, the set of points within a taxicab distance of 3/5 forms a square pyramid.  The base of the pyramid is a square in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the vertex to the center of the cube.  The height of the pyramid is 3/5.\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Removed Regions:**\n\n*   For each vertex, calculate the volume of the square pyramid.  The volume of a square pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height.\n*   The base area is the area of the square.  The side length of the square is 3/5.  So the base area is (3/5)^2.\n*   The height of the pyramid is 3/5.\n*   Calculate the volume of the pyramid for one vertex: (1/3) * (3/5)^2 * (3/5) = (1/3) * (27/125) = 9/125.\n*   Since there are 8 vertices, multiply the volume of one pyramid by 8: 8 * (9/125) = 72/125.\n\n**6. Calculate the Volume of the Original Cube:**\n\n*   The volume of the original cube is 1 * 1 * 1 = 1.\n\n**7. Calculate the Volume of the Remaining Region:**\n\n*   Subtract the volume of the removed regions from the volume of the original cube: 1 - 72/125 = 53/125.\n\n**8. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The volume of the region $\\mathcal{R}$ is 53/125.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Consider Substitution:**\n\n*   Let's try to find a substitution that can relate the two equations.

Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Range of n:** `n` can be 0 to 9999, which means we're dealing with 4-digit numbers (including leading zeros).\n*   **Digit Sum:** The sum of the digits of `n` can range from 0 (for n=0) to 36 (for n=9999).\n*   **s(n) Range:** The minimum value of `s(n)` is 0 (when n=0).

A set automatically handles duplicates.\n*   **Count Unique Values:** The size of the set will give us the number of distinct values of `s(n)`.\n\n**4.

Identify the Relevant Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Area of a Triangle:** The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.\n*   **Trigonometry:** We can use the tangent function to find the height of the triangle.\n*   **Right Triangle:** The tangent function relates the opposite and adjacent sides of a right triangle. We can use this to find the height of the triangle.\n*   **Pythagorean Theorem:** We can use this to find the length of the third side of the triangle if needed.\n\n**3. Plan the Solution:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Use the Tangent Function to Find the Height:**\n    *   Consider triangle ABC. Let's drop a perpendicular from point B to side AC, intersecting AC at point D. This creates a right triangle ABD.\n    *   In triangle ABD, angle BAD is equal to angle BAC (since they are the same angle).\n    *   We know tan(angle BAC) = -4/3. This means that the ratio of the opposite side (BD) to the adjacent side (AD) is -4/3.\n    *   Since we are dealing with a triangle, we can assume the height (BD) is positive. The negative sign in the tangent value indicates that the angle is obtuse (greater than 90 degrees). However, we can still use the absolute value of the tangent to find the height.\n    *   Let's assume the length of AD is 3 units. Then, the length of BD (the height) would be 4 units.\n    *   We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB (which is given as 5 units). This will help us verify our calculations.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Triangle:**\n    *   We now have the base (AC = 6 units) and the height (BD = 4 units).\n    *   Use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height.\n\n**4.

        "question": "<input> Derek starts at the point $(0,0)$, facing the point $(0,1)$, and he wants to get to the point $(1,1)$. He takes unit steps parallel to the coordinate axes. A move consists of either a step forward, or a $90^{\\circ}$ right (clockwise) turn followed by a step forward, so that his path does not contain any left turns. His path is restricted to the square region defined by $0 \\leq x \\leq 17$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 17$. Compute the number of ways he can get to $(1,1)$ without returning to any previously visited point. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Movement Rules:**\n\n*   Derek starts at (0,0) facing (0,1).\n*   He can move forward (in the direction he's facing) or make a 90-degree right turn followed by a forward step.\n*   He cannot make left turns.\n*   His path must not revisit any previously visited point.\n*   The path is restricted to the square region defined by 0 \u2264 x \u2264 17 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 17.\n\n**2. Model the Problem:**\n\n*   Represent Derek's position and direction as a state. The state can be represented as (x, y, direction), where direction can be 0 (up), 1 (right), 2 (down), or 3 (left).\n*   The problem becomes a pathfinding problem with constraints.\n\n**3. Define the Constraints:**\n\n*   No revisiting of points: The path must not visit any point more than once.\n*   Movement restrictions: Derek can only move forward or make a right turn followed by a forward step.\n*   Boundary constraints: The path must stay within the square defined by 0 \u2264 x \u2264 17 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 17.\n\n**4. Develop a Recursive/Backtracking Approach:**\n\n*   Use a recursive function to simulate Derek's movement.\n*   The function will take the current position, direction, and a set of visited points as parameters.\n*   At each step, the function will consider the two possible moves (forward or right turn + forward).\n*   For each move, the function will check if the new position is within the square and not already visited.\n*   If the move is valid, the function will recursively call itself with the updated position, direction, and visited points.\n*   The base case is when Derek reaches the point (1,1).\n\n**5. Optimize the Solution:**\n\n*   To avoid redundant calculations, memoize the results of subproblems. However, due to the constraints of the problem, memoization may not be effective.\n*   Consider using dynamic programming to store the number of ways to reach each point from each direction, considering the visited points.\n\n**6. Consider the Path Length:**\n\n*   Derek needs to move from (0,0) to (1,1). The minimum number of steps is 2 (right then up).\n*   The maximum number of steps is limited by the size of the square (17x17). However, the path cannot revisit any points, so the maximum number of steps is limited by the number of points in the square.\n\n**7. Consider the Direction Changes:**\n\n*   Derek can only make right turns. This means his direction will change in a predictable pattern.\n*   The direction will cycle through up, right, down, left, and back to up.\n\n**8. Consider the Path Constraints:**\n\n*   The path must not revisit any points. This means that the path must be a self-avoiding walk.\n*   The path is restricted to the square defined by 0 \u2264 x \u2264 17 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 17.\n\n**9. Consider the Final Answer:**\n\n*   The final answer is the number of valid paths that Derek can take to reach (1,1) without revisiting any points.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Plan of Action:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Let the roots of the first equation be $r_1, r_2, r_3$.**  Since the first equation is $x^3 + Ax + 10 = 0$, we can apply Vieta's formulas:\n    *   $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 0$ (since the coefficient of $x^2$ is 0)\n    *   $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = A$\n    *   $r_1r_2r_3 = -10$\n\n*   **Step 2: Let the roots of the second equation be $r_1, r_2, s$.**  Since the second equation is $x^3 + Bx^2 + 50 = 0$, we can apply Vieta's formulas:\n    *   $r_1 + r_2 + s = -B$\n    *   $r_1r_2 + r_1s + r_2s = 0$ (since the coefficient of $x$ is 0)\n    *   $r_1r_2s = -50$\n\n*   **Step 3: Use the common roots.**  Since $r_1$ and $r_2$ are common roots, we can equate the expressions for the sum of the roots and the product of the roots from the two equations.\n\n*   **Step 4: Solve for the product of the common roots.**  We need to find $r_1r_2$.  We can use the equations from Step 1 and Step 2 to find $r_1r_2$.\n\n**4. Execution:**\n\n*   From the first equation, we have $r_1r_2r_3 = -10$.\n*   From the second equation, we have $r_1r_2s = -50$.\n*   Divide the second equation by the first equation: $\\frac{r_1r_2s}{r_1r_2r_3} = \\frac{-50}{-10}$\n*   Simplify: $\\frac{s}{r_3} = 5$\n*   Therefore, $s = 5r_3$\n*   Substitute $s = 5r_3$ into the equation $r_1 + r_2 + s = -B$ from the second equation: $r_1 + r_2 + 5r_3 = -B$\n*   From the first equation, we have $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 0$.  Substitute this into the previous equation: $0 + 4r_3 = -B$\n*   Therefore, $B = -4r_3$\n*   From the first equation, we have $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = A$\n*   From the second equation, we have $r_1r_2 + r_1s + r_2s = 0$\n*   Substitute $s = 5r_3$ into the second equation: $r_1r_2 + 5r_1r_3 + 5r_2r_3 = 0$\n*   Substitute $r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = A$ into the previous equation: $A + 4r_1r_3 + 4r_2r_3 = 0$\n*   Factor out 4: $A + 4(r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) = 0$\n*   From the first equation, we have $r_1r_2r_3 = -10$\n*   We can solve for $r_1r_2$ using the equations we have derived.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Compute the length $A B$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information:**\n\n*   **T = 23:** This is a constant value.\n*   **Triangle ABC:** We know it's an isosceles triangle (AB = AC).\n*   **Altitude from A to BC:** This is a key piece of information. The length of this altitude is given as \u221aT.\n*   **BC = T - K:** This relates the length of the base of the triangle to the root of a cubic equation.\n*   **K is the real root of the equation x\u00b3 - 8x\u00b2 - 8x - 9 = 0:** This is a cubic equation. We need to find the real root K.\n\n**2. Plan to Find K:**\n\n*   **Use the Rational Root Theorem:** This theorem can help us identify potential rational roots of the cubic equation. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term (9) divided by factors of the leading coefficient (1). So, the possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b19.\n*   **Test the Possible Rational Roots:** Substitute each of the possible rational roots into the cubic equation. If any of them satisfy the equation, that's the real root K.\n*   **If no rational root is found:** We'll need to use numerical methods (like the Newton-Raphson method) to approximate the real root K.\n\n**3. Plan to Find AB:**\n\n*   **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:** Since we know the altitude from A to BC and the length of BC, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of AB.\n*   **Let the altitude from A to BC be h:** We know h = \u221aT.\n*   **Let the length of BC be b:** We know b = T - K.\n*   **Let the length of AB be x:** This is the value we need to find.\n*   **Let the length of the segment from the foot of the altitude to B be d:** This is half of BC, so d = b/2.\n*   **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:** We have a right triangle with legs h and d, and hypotenuse x. So, x\u00b2 = h\u00b2 + d\u00b2.\n*   **Substitute the known values:** x\u00b2 = (\u221aT)\u00b2 + (b/2)\u00b2.\n*   **Solve for x:** x = sqrt((\u221aT)\u00b2 + (b/2)\u00b2).\n\n**4. Final Steps:**\n\n*   **Calculate the value of K:** Use the Rational Root Theorem and numerical methods to find the real root K.\n*   **Calculate the value of b:** b = T - K.\n*   **Calculate the value of AB:** Use the Pythagorean Theorem with the values of T, K, and b.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Find the Side Length of the Cube:**\n\n*   Solve for $s$ in the equation $s^3 = 6$.  This will give us the side length of the cube.\n\n**4. Calculate the Surface Area of the Cube:**\n\n*   The surface area of a cube is $6s^2$.  Substitute the value of $s$ found in step 3 into this formula.\n\n**5.

Each vertex is the intersection of 3 faces.\n*   **Coloring:** Each face has a 50% chance of being red or blue.\n*   **Vertex Sharing:** A vertex is shared by 3 faces. We need to ensure that no vertex has all 3 faces of the same color.\n*   **Complementary Probability:** It might be easier to calculate the probability of the *complement* event (i.e., at least one vertex has all 3 faces of the same color) and then subtract it from 1.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Complementary Probability Approach:**\n    *   Calculate the probability that *at least one* vertex has all 3 faces of the same color.\n    *   Subtract this probability from 1 to get the desired probability.\n\n*   **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**  This will be necessary to account for overlapping events (i.e., multiple vertices having all 3 faces of the same color).\n\n**4. Steps to Calculate the Complement Probability:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the probability that a specific vertex has all 3 faces of the same color.**\n    *   There are 2 possible colors for the 3 faces (all red or all blue).\n    *   The probability of all 3 faces being red is (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n    *   The probability of all 3 faces being blue is also (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n    *   So, the probability that a specific vertex has all 3 faces of the same color is 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4.\n\n*   **Step 2: Calculate the probability that at least one vertex has all 3 faces of the same color.**\n    *   There are 8 vertices in a cube.\n    *   Let A_i be the event that vertex i has all 3 faces of the same color.\n    *   We need to calculate P(A_1 \u222a A_2 \u222a ... \u222a A_8).\n    *   Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:\n        *   P(A_1 \u222a A_2 \u222a ... \u222a A_8) = \u03a3P(A_i) - \u03a3P(A_i \u2229 A_j) + \u03a3P(A_i \u2229 A_j \u2229 A_k) - ... + (-1)^{n+1}P(A_1 \u2229 A_2 \u2229 ... \u2229 A_8)}\n    *   Calculate each term:\n        *   \u03a3P(A_i): There are 8 vertices, each with a probability of 1/4. So, \u03a3P(A_i) = 8 * 1/4 = 2.\n        *   \u03a3P(A_i \u2229 A_j): This is the probability that two specific vertices have all 3 faces of the same color. This depends on whether the two vertices share a common face or not. This will require careful analysis.\n        *   \u03a3P(A_i \u2229 A_j \u2229 A_k): This is the probability that three specific vertices have all 3 faces of the same color. This will also require careful analysis.\n        *   ... and so on for higher-order intersections.\n\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the desired probability.**\n    *   Subtract the probability calculated in Step 2 from 1.\n\n**5. Considerations and Challenges:**\n\n*   The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle will become complex as we consider intersections of events (i.e., multiple vertices having all 3 faces of the same color).\n*   We need to carefully consider the relationships between the vertices and the faces to calculate the probabilities of intersections.\n*   The problem might be simplified by considering the cube's symmetry.\n\n**6.

Given that points $C, O$, and $P$ are collinear, compute $r$. </input>\n</think>\n\n<plan> Here's a plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Geometry:**\n\n*   **Triangle ABC:** Right-angled at C, with AC = BC = sqrt(T-3). This makes it an isosceles right triangle.\n*   **Circles O and P:** Both have radius r. Circle O is tangent to AC and BC. Circle P is externally tangent to circle O and AB. Points C, O, and P are collinear.\n\n**2. Determine Key Measurements:**\n\n*   **Calculate the length of AB:** Since ABC is a right-angled isosceles triangle, AB = AC * sqrt(2) = sqrt(T-3) * sqrt(2).\n*   **Calculate the height of the triangle (from C to AB):** This will be useful for finding the position of circle P. The height can be calculated using the area of the triangle.\n\n**3. Analyze Circle O:**\n\n*   **Position of Circle O:** Since it's tangent to AC and BC, its center lies on the angle bisector of angle C. In an isosceles right triangle, the angle bisector of the right angle is also the median and the altitude. Therefore, the center of circle O lies on the line from C to the midpoint of AB.\n*   **Distance from C to O:** The distance from C to O is equal to the radius r. This is because the circle is tangent to AC and BC, and the center lies on the angle bisector.\n\n**4. Analyze Circle P:**\n\n*   **Position of Circle P:** Circle P is externally tangent to circle O and AB. Since points C, O, and P are collinear, the center of circle P lies on the line from C to O.\n*   **Distance from C to P:** The distance from C to P is equal to the radius r plus the distance from O to P. The distance from O to P can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, since the centers of the circles and the point of tangency form a right triangle.\n*   **Distance from P to AB:** The distance from P to AB is equal to the radius r. This is because the circle is tangent to AB.\n\n**5. Set up Equations:**\n\n*   **Equation 1:** The distance from C to P is equal to the distance from C to O plus the distance from O to P. This can be expressed as:  r + r = r + (distance from O to P)\n*   **Equation 2:** The distance from P to AB is equal to the radius r. This can be expressed as: (distance from C to AB) - (distance from C to P) = r\n\n**6. Solve for r:**\n\n*   Use the equations from steps 4 and 5 to solve for r.

We then need to calculate a specific value involving the coefficients and exponents of the scientific notation.\n\n2.  **Scientific Notation:** Recognize that $p = 6.6 \\times 10^{-27}$ is already in scientific notation. The goal is to find $\\sqrt{p}$ in the form $a \\times 10^b$, where $1 \\leq a < 10$ and $b$ is an integer.\n\n3.  **Square Root of Scientific Notation:** Recall that the square root of a number in scientific notation can be calculated by taking the square root of the coefficient and halving the exponent.

We can rewrite $10^{-13.5}$ as $10^{-13} \\times 10^{-0.5}$.\n\n6.  **Adjust the Coefficient:**  We need to adjust the coefficient to ensure it is between 1 and 10.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Determine the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to turn all $ n $ switches on, given that she must flip exactly 2 switches each minute.\n*   **Constraints:** Each switch starts off. Flipping a switch toggles its state (on/off). The puzzle is impossible if it's not possible to have all switches on at the end of any minute.\n\n**2. Analyze the Problem for Small Even Values of n:**\n\n*   **n = 2:**  We know $ E(2, 2) = 1 $.  She can flip both switches in the first minute.\n*   **n = 4:**  Let's explore possible strategies.\n    *   **Strategy 1:** Flip switches 1 and 2 in the first minute, 1 and 3 in the second, 1 and 4 in the third, and 2 and 3 in the fourth.  This results in all switches being on after 4 minutes.\n    *   **Strategy 2:**  Is there a faster way?  Let's consider the parity of the number of times each switch is flipped.  Since we need all switches to be on, each switch must be flipped an odd number of times.  Since we flip 2 switches each minute, the total number of flips is even.  Therefore, the number of switches that need to be flipped an odd number of times must be even.  For n=4, this is possible.  However, the question is whether we can achieve this in fewer than 4 minutes.\n*   **n = 6:**  Similar to n=4, we need to find a strategy that flips each switch an odd number of times, with a total of an even number of flips.\n\n**3. Generalize the Pattern:**\n\n*   **Observation:**  For even $ n $, the minimum number of minutes required seems to be $ n/2 $.  This is because we need to flip each switch an odd number of times, and we flip 2 switches per minute.  The total number of flips is even, and the number of switches that need to be flipped an odd number of times is even.\n*   **Hypothesis:**  $ E(n, 2) = n/2 $ for even $ n $.\n\n**4. Prove the Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Base Case:**  $ n = 2 $:  $ E(2, 2) = 1 = 2/2 $.  The base case holds.\n*   **Inductive Step:**  Assume that $ E(k, 2) = k/2 $ for some even $ k $.  We need to show that $ E(k+2, 2) = (k+2)/2 $.\n    *   **Strategy:**  Use the inductive hypothesis to flip the first $ k $ switches in $ k/2 $ minutes.

        "question": "<input> Elizabeth is in an \"escape room\" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle.

At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$.

Identify Patterns and Develop a Strategy:**\n\n*   **Observation:**  Each minute, $ k = n-2 $ switches are flipped.  This means that $ 2 $ switches remain unflipped each minute.\n*   **Key Insight:**  To turn all switches on, we need to flip each switch an odd number of times.  Since we are flipping $ n-2 $ switches each minute, we need to find a way to ensure that each switch is flipped an odd number of times.\n*   **Strategy:**  Consider the following:\n    *   Each switch must be flipped an odd number of times.\n    *   Each minute, $ n-2 $ switches are flipped.\n    *   We need to find a sequence of switch flips that results in each switch being flipped an odd number of times.\n\n**4. Consider the Parity of the Number of Flips:**\n\n*   **Parity Analysis:**  Since we are flipping $ n-2 $ switches each minute, the number of switches flipped is always even (since $ n-2 $ is even for $ n \\geq 5 $).\n*   **Implication:**  The number of switches that are flipped an odd number of times must be even.  This is because each flip changes the state of a switch (on to off or off to on).  If a switch is flipped an odd number of times, it will end up on.  If it's flipped an even number of times, it will end up off.\n\n**5.

Analyze the Problem:**\n\n*   **State Space:** The number of possible states (combinations of switch states) is $ 2^n $. This is a large number, so brute-force methods are not feasible.\n*   **Parity Considerations:** The parity (even/odd) of the number of switches flipped each minute is important.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We have 8 students.\n*   We need to create selfies with either 2 or 3 students.\n*   Each pair of students must appear in exactly one selfie.\n*   We need to find the *minimum* number of selfies required.\n\n**2. Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Combinations:** The number of ways to choose `k` items from a set of `n` items is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n*   **Total Pairs:** The total number of unique pairs of students is C(8, 2) = 28.\n*   **Pairs per Selfie:** A 2-student selfie contains 1 pair. A 3-student selfie contains C(3, 2) = 3 pairs.\n*   **Optimization:** We want to minimize the number of selfies. This suggests we should maximize the number of pairs per selfie. Therefore, we should prioritize using 3-student selfies.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs (28).**\n*   **Step 2: Determine the maximum number of pairs that can be covered by 3-student selfies.**  Since each 3-student selfie can cover 3 pairs, we can calculate how many 3-student selfies are needed to cover as many pairs as possible.\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the remaining pairs after using 3-student selfies.**  If there are any pairs left, we will need to use 2-student selfies to cover them.\n*   **Step 4: Calculate the total number of selfies.**  This will be the sum of the number of 3-student selfies and the number of 2-student selfies.\n\n**4. Execution:**\n\n*   Calculate the total number of pairs: C(8, 2) = 28.\n*   Calculate the maximum number of pairs that can be covered by 3-student selfies: 28 / 3 = 9.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a selfie, we'll use 9 3-student selfies.

Strategy for Minimizing Morphs:**\n\n*   **Key Insight:** A morph increases the difference between the two terms it acts on.

Then, the number of digits in $2N$ will be $d+1$.\n*   The smallest number with $d$ digits is $10^{d-1}$.\n*   The largest number with $d$ digits is $10^d - 1$.\n*   The smallest number with $d+1$ digits is $10^d$.\n*   Therefore, for $2N$ to have $d+1$ digits, we need $2N \\geq 10^d$.\n*   This implies $N \\geq \\frac{10^d}{2}$.\n*   Also, since $N$ has $d$ digits, we know $N < 10^d$.\n\n**3. Determine the Range of N:**\n\n*   For a given $d$, the values of $N$ that satisfy the condition are in the range $\\left[\\frac{10^d}{2}, 10^d - 1\\right]$.\n*   The number of integers in this range is $10^d - 1 - \\frac{10^d}{2} + 1 = \\frac{10^d}{2}$.\n\n**4. Find the Value of d:**\n\n*   We need to find the smallest $d$ such that the total number of integers in the ranges for all $d' < d$ is less than 2011.\n*   This means we need to find the smallest $d$ such that $\\sum_{d'=1}^{d-1} \\frac{10^{d'}}{2} < 2011$.\n\n**5. Calculate the 2011th Number:**\n\n*   Once we have the value of $d$, we can determine the range of $N$ values that have $d$ digits and satisfy the condition.\n*   The 2011th number will be the 2011th number in the sequence of numbers that satisfy the condition.\n\n**6. Final Answer:**\n\n*   The final answer will be the value of $N$ that is the 2011th number in the sequence.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",

Key Concepts and Formulas:**\n\n*   **Tangency and Right Triangles:** When a sphere is tangent to a plane, the line segment from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the plane. This forms a right triangle with the radius of the sphere, the distance from the center to the plane, and the distance from the point of tangency to the center.\n*   **Similar Triangles:** The triangles formed by the centers of the spheres and the points of tangency are similar.\n*   **Area of a Triangle:** The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height.\n*   **Pythagorean Theorem:** This will be useful for finding the lengths of sides in right triangles.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the Height of the Triangle (PQR):**  Since the spheres are tangent to the plane, the distance from the centers of the spheres to the plane is equal to the radius of the spheres.  We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the height of the triangle PQR.  The height will be the distance from the plane to the center of the sphere.\n*   **Step 2: Find the Lengths of the Sides of Triangle PQR:**  We can use the distances between the points of tangency (P', Q', R') and the height of the triangle to find the lengths of the sides of triangle PQR.  This will involve using the Pythagorean Theorem again.\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Area of Triangle PQR:**  Once we have the lengths of the sides of triangle PQR, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the answer.\n\n**4. Implementation:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the Height of the Triangle (PQR):**  Let the radius of the spheres be r.  Then, the height of the triangle PQR is r.\n*   **Step 2: Find the Lengths of the Sides of Triangle PQR:**  The length of the side PQ is the distance between the centers of the spheres P and Q.  This can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem: PQ = sqrt((P'Q')^2 + (r)^2).  Similarly, QR = sqrt((Q'R')^2 + (r)^2), and PR = sqrt((P'R')^2 + (r)^2).\n*   **Step 3: Calculate the Area of Triangle PQR:**  Use the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height.  The base can be any side of the triangle, and the height is the distance from the opposite vertex to the base.  Alternatively, we can use Heron's formula if we know all three sides.\n\n**5.

Understand the Problem:**\n\n*   We have two functions: a line $y = 4x$ and a curve $y = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x$.\n*   We need to find the total length of the segments of the line $y = 4x$ that lie in the first quadrant (where $x > 0$ and $y > 0$) and are below the curve $y = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x$.\n\n**2. Find the Points of Intersection:**\n\n*   To determine where the line and the curve intersect, set the two equations equal to each other: $4x = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x$.\n*   Solve for $x$. This will give us the x-coordinates of the points where the line and the curve intersect.\n*   Since we are only interested in the first quadrant, we will focus on the positive x-values.\n\n**3.

Sum the Lengths:**\n\n*   If there are multiple intervals where the line lies below the curve, we will need to evaluate the integral for each interval and then sum the results.\n*   The final answer will be the sum of the lengths of all the segments of the line $y = 4x$ that lie below the curve $y = 10\\pi \\sin^2 x$ in the first quadrant.\n </plan>\n\nLet's execute the plan step by step and provide your final answer inside \\boxed{} notation.",
